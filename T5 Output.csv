4,4,The trouble with poaching ex-customers,"In our consulting work, we often see that sales people are under amisconception: they think that they “own the customer”.Or to state themisconception in the language of the data protection law, they think that theyare free to do whatever they like with personal data about their customers,including their ex-customers.They forget that individuals have the right tocontrol the ways in which their personal data is used or disclosed.This misconception gives rise to sales people “poaching ex-customers” –moving to a new organisation and marketing to “their customers” at theirprevious organisation.If they do this without the consent of the individualsconcerned, the sales people and their new organisation will generally fail tocomply with the data protection law.The following case studies demonstrate how this has caused trouble inthe past.Client personal data used by ex-employee to market new employer’sofferingsA salesman moved from one organisation (“Organisation A”) to anotherorganisation (“Organisation B”).Using Organisation B’s letterhead, thesalesman sent a marketing letter to one of his customers at Organisation A.The salesman had recorded the customer’s contact details in his personaldiary during the course of his business relationship with them when heworked at Organisation A. The letter stated that he had moved to a differentemployer, Organisation B, and was promoting offerings from Organisation B.The customer complained to the regulator on the basis that neither thesalesman nor Organisation B had obtained consent to use the customer’spersonal data to send marketing communications.1■The regulator:instructed Organisation B to destroy the customer’s personal data■■concluded that Organisation A was at fault for failing to ensure securitymeasures were in place to protect the personal data in its care andrecommended that the data protection provisions in the employee contractof Organisation A be amended to include specific reference to the use ofpersonal data to prevent any ambiguity.The previous contract referred tothe use of business data.The regulator wrote in its report that:there appears to be a misconception by some employees that thecustomers are their customers rather than that of the datacontroller, that is, the employer.Data controllers must be awarethat where they process data which has been brought in to theorganisation by a new employee from their previous employment,without the consent of the individuals, they are in breach of theData Protection Act .Client personal data retained by ex-employeeA life insurance agent left his agency (“Organisation A”) and joined adifferent company (“Organisation B”).He then called one of “his clients” atOrganisation A and asked her if she would like to transfer her life insurancepolicies from Organisation A to Organisation B or, as an alternative, if shewould like to take out new policies with Organisation B.When the client met with the agent to discuss the proposed changes shedid not have the documents relating to her existing policies with OrganisationA readily at hand. “No problem,” said the agent.He opened his laptopcomputer and brought up details of her existing policy.The client was horrified that confidential personal data relating to herlife insurance was still available to an ex-employee of Organisation A. Shewas even more unhappy that this could happen when the ex-employee nowworked for a competitor.The client confronted Organisation A about the incident.However, shewas not satisfied that Organisation A treated the breach of confidentialitywith the seriousness it deserved.Consequently, she escalated the matter tothe regulator, which investigated it.2■Organisation A told the regulator that:its field representatives were allowed access to client information onlaptop computers■■its data protection policies stated that if field representatives left theiremployment with Organisation A they must return their laptop computerand all company records and documents to their immediate supervisorandthe former employee had violated Organisation A’s policy and did notreturn the laptop.It was this violation of policy that had given rise to the complaint.As aresult, the regulator required Organisation A to put new procedures in placeso that client data would be erased automatically from all laptop computersevery six weeks and would be erased automatically whenever a fieldrepresentative ceased to be employed by Organisation A.A final wordAs you can see from the above examples, clients or customers may notappreciate being contacted by ex-sales people.They also get upset knowingthat their personal data is being retained when a salesperson leaves anorganisation.If you do have a close relationship with a customer, inform them that youare leaving the company and get unambiguous consent from them beforecontinuing to use their personal data.But, in addition, ensure that you do not breach the obligation ofconfidentiality you have to your ex-employer or, if you are working as anagent, your ex-principal.And ensure that you comply with the data protectionlaw.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES – MANAGERS ANDEMPLOYERSManagers and employers should adopt the following practices when their employees orsalespersons leave their organisation, or when new employees join the organisation:■■■■Require your employees and agents to sign a confidentiality obligation.Have a clearwritten policy that is consistent with those confidentiality obligations.Require them to return all the organisation’s property when they leave.Require them to return all the organisation’s documents and not make and/or keep anycopy of them (including a copy on any personal computer that they may have used toaccess the organisation’s personal data remotely).Wherever possible, have technical controls to prevent ex-employees and agents fromremotely accessing the organisation’s confidential information or personal data.If this is■not feasible, put in place technical controls to keep track of any remote access, andparticularly any downloads.Do not use (or disclose) personal data brought into your organisation by new employeesunless you are satisfied that:••the relevant individuals have given their consent to your organisation using (ordisclosing) it for the stated purpose andthe new employees are not in breach of any confidentiality or similar obligation to theirprevious organisation (who might be able to sue your organisation for inducing breachof that obligation).■ Ensure that all new employees (and agents), especially salespersons, are trained in theirobligations under the data protection law and your organisation’s data protection policiesand practices.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES – SALESPERSONSIndividual salespersons who have left their previous organisation and have joined a neworganisation should adhere to the following:■■■■Do not take customers’ personal data with you unless authorised to do so.Observe the employee/agent exit requirements when leaving an organisation.Do not contact any of your clients from your previous organisation for any purposes,including to market to them, unless you have their consent to do so.Even if you have their consent, check that a contact is not in violation of anyconfidentiality obligation you have to your previous organisation.12Data Protection Commissioner, Ireland, Case 14.https://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Case-Studies-2012/1354.htm#14Data Protection Commissioner, Ireland, Case Study 2/99,https://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Case-Study-2-99-Life-Insurance-Company/137.htm 21",,," What do salespeople forget?

5,5,Shhhh… Speak softly for privacy’s sake,"Many of us at one time or another would have been to a public library.Oneof the things we would have noticed are signs displayed prominently in bigletters that spell the word “SILENCE”.This is to remind library users tokeep quiet, or at least speak softly, so as not to disturb others who are thereto concentrate on serious reading or studying.Many a time we would havebeen ticked off by a stern-looking librarian when our verbal communicationvolume crossed a certain threshold.Where communications containing personal data and sensitive informationcan be overheardWithout the seven-letter word “SILENCE” to remind people at other publicplaces, I’m often amazed at how much private information is being disclosedwithin earshot of others around them, especially at restaurants and foodcourts.Not that I like to eavesdrop on other people’s conversations, but Ican’t help it when people speak loudly and their sound waves travel into myeardrums. “Do you know so-and-so is having an affair with… ?”, “Have youheard so-and-so’s son is suffering from… ?”are the usual type of gossip Ioften pick up.Doctors’ clinics are another place where private information is routinelydisclosed – to the doctors in the privacy of their consulting room and to thereceptionists or nurses in the clinic’s reception area and waiting room.Andthis is without a “SILENCE” sign to remind them to speak softly.On visits tosome doctors’ clinics, I never fail to be amazed by receptionists and nurseswho must think that all patients are hard of hearing.They speak so loudly thateveryone in the clinic can hear distinctly:The doctor will see you next week for your <name of medicalcondition> .orYour total bill for today’s visit is $xxx .I had an interesting encounter at a doctor’s clinic once.As I was a first-timepatient to this clinic, the receptionist asked me for my national identificationnumber, name, home address, telephone number, blood type and drugallergies.All the while the receptionist was talking very loudly.She repeatedeverything I said.Everyone in the clinic’s waiting room heard everythingabout my personal and medical details.The clinic should have takenmeasures to protect my privacy as it has an obligation to do so under the dataprotection law.For example, the receptionist should have been required tospeak more discreetly with a lower voice or told not to repeat my personaldata.Or the clinic could have changed its data collection process so that Iwas simply asked to write down my personal data.Think before you speak… especially if you speak loudlyWe are increasingly aware of the need to protect personal data aboutindividuals from being viewed or accessed by other individuals who do nothave a genuine “need to know”.But this is not enough.It is equally important to take care about the volume of our conversations,both face-to-face and on the phone.And organisations too must ensure thattheir employees are aware of the need to observe the volume of theirconversations on behalf of the organisation.In both cases, individuals mustmake sure that the personal data and private information of individuals beingdiscussed are not inadvertently overheard by people around them.This is always important.But it is especially important when individualsare discussing sensitive personal data, such as identity card numbers andmedical or financial information.And it’s just as important not to beoverheard during a phone conversation as it is to avoid being overheardduring a face-to-face conversation.For privacy’s sake, speak softly!CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should adopt the following practices when communicating personal data orsensitive information:■■Speak softly and discreetly on the phone and in face-to-face conversation, lest you areoverheard by people around you who are not supposed to know.Train and remind employees on how to communicate softly and discreetly at all times.23",,," Who was ticked off by when our verbal communicationvolume crossed a certain threshold?

8,8,The perils of file exchange and sharing,"Do you or your organisation use cloud storage services such as Dropbox andGoogle Drive, which are hugely popular among many property agents,insurance agents and other mobile workers?Or do you often share personaldata through email with other employees in your organisation or third-parties?If so, you need to be alert to at least the following three sets ofrequirements:■Information security policyYou need to know whether what you are doing is permitted by yourorganisation’s information security policy.Or, in the case of individualsunder an agency contract with an organisation, whether it is permitted byyour agency agreement with that organisation.If that information security policy is silent about using these types ofcloud storage services, we suggest it should be amended either to permitit (and to include any protocols that employees are required to follow) orto forbid it.While forbidding it is likely an unpopular and probably inconvenient■■outcome, it is better than not raising questions about it now and findingout later when there is a problem that you are blamed for it.And thatunpleasant consequences may attach to that blame.Data protection lawYou need to know whether what you are doing is permitted by the dataprotection law, which requires personal data in the possession or underthe control of an organisation to be protected by that organisation.Sectoral regulationsYou need to know whether what you are doing is permitted by anysectoral regulations that apply to the organisation. (For example, thecentral bank in your jurisdiction may have made regulations that apply toyour organisation’s use of cloud storage services.)The perils of file exchange and file sharingMost users of file sharing services or those sharing files via email are notaware that they are creating potential data protection issues andcompromising security for their organisations if they only use the defaultfunctions and basic features within the service.This creates governance, riskand compliance issues for the organisation.As mentioned above, it can leadto trouble and blame for you.In one survey in the US1, approximately 61% of respondents confessedthey often or frequently:■■■■sent unencrypted emailsdid not delete confidential documents or files as required by applicableorganisational policiesaccidentally forwarded files or documents to individuals not authorisedto see themused personal file sharing/sync-and-share apps in the workplace.Major risks for organisations include the following:■■Hackers being able to gain access to your file sync-and-share system andthen taking control of it.They might then have access to an unprecedentedamount of your organisation’s information, including personal data.Access might extend to your organisation’s client’s information, includingpersonal data, too.Employees sharing documents or files containing personal data by emailwith other employees who are not authorised to see it and/or with third-parties who are not authorised to see it.Then it becomes even more precarious, especially if your documentsare unprotected and can easily be accessed.How many times have weheard of employees who carelessly shared confidential documents withothers who are not authorised to view that information?In one instance reported in the papers in Singapore in 2015, a teacheraccidentally sent out the personal data of 1,900 pupils to parents.Aspreadsheet attached to an email to parents contained the names and birthcertificate numbers of every pupil in the school, along with the names,phone numbers and email addresses of their parents.Tips to minimise the perils of file exchange and file sharingHere is a list of tips for achieving reasonable protection when exchanging orsharing files online, although more may be necessary in particularcircumstances, for example if the personal data shared is sensitive.Use two-factor or multi-factor authentication when logging into your cloudserviceDropbox2 and Google Drive3, for example, both offer several optionalsecurity functions.One of them is two-factor authentication, which includesusing one-time-password tokens.With two-step verification enabled, youwill have to enter both your usual password and a security code that is sentto your mobile phone whenever you sign in to the Dropbox website or add anew device to your accountThe outcome of two-factor authentication is that even if someone knowsyour Dropbox or Google Drive password, they will not be able to log in toyour account unless they can also obtain the time-sensitive code from yourphone.Password-protect or encrypt the documentWhenever you share a Microsoft Office document or PDF document thatincludes personal data or other confidential information, you shouldpassword-protect it.The relevant applications allow you to save thedocuments with a password.A strong password should prevent a hacker or other unauthorisedindividual from opening your document.But of course you must protect your strong password too.Call therecipient to tell them the password or send it to them in an SMS.If there is noalternative but to email the password to the recipient, send it in an emailseparate from the email to which you have attached the document.And avoidsending the two separate emails within seconds of each other and with thesame subject heading.Sometimes you may need to share an image of a document, such as apassport or driver’s licence, which is obviously sensitive personal data.Image files cannot easily be encrypted or protected with passwords.Therefore you should embed the image file in a Word document first and thenpassword-protect the Word document.Advanced users should explore using dedicated encryption tools toencrypt their documents or folders4.Verify the recipient’s email address for accuracy – and be stingy when you“cc”Although getting email addresses correct sounds very straightforward, manyindividuals still send files to the wrong recipients carelessly.The auto-find/select feature in many email programs that automatically selects a namebased on whichever letter or partial name you type can lead to errors.If youoften send emails containing personal data, eliminate this risk by turning thefeature off.Otherwise, always be very careful, especially when you are in ahurry.Be very stingy about who you include in any “cc” to an email where it, oran attachment to it, includes personal data.If several individuals need to seethe message in the email, but not all of them need to see, or are authorised tosee, the personal data in an attachment, send the email without the attachment.Then send a separate email with the attachment only to those individuals whoneed to see the personal data and are authorised to see it.This should reducethe risk of data exposure or leakage as well as enabling you to comply withyour organisation’s policy about who has access to personal data.A further quick note on emails – protecting the personal data of recipientstooSometimes you need to send emails to multiple individuals, including wherethere is an attachment that contains personal data.Take some time to think about whether or not it is appropriate for eachrecipient to see each of the other recipients’ email addresses.And whetheror not it is appropriate for each of them to know who else will see thepersonal data in the attachment to the email.If in any doubt include all the recipients under blind copy/“bcc” so thatno recipient can see the email addresses of other recipients or see who elsewill view the personal data in the attachment to the email.Check or verify who and what links you are sharingWhen you share documents using Dropbox, Google Drive or other filesharing services, you send a link to the individual or individuals with whomyou want to share them.Because you see only one link, it is easy to forgetthat you have a particular document that is shared with multiple individuals.It is also easy to forget that they can forward the link to just about anyone.Always be aware of what files you are sharing and verify who has accessto them.Be careful about the permissions you give to the recipient, such asthe ability to edit or add new files.You should regularly review shared access rights to your documents andfolders.You should retire the links that are no longer being used or no longerrequired.Dropbox, for example, allows you to see which files you haveshared and with whom – you can easily decide what files or folders shouldor should not continue to be accessible and to whom.The same logic appliesif you are syncing multiple devices or sharing folders with others.Unlinkdevices you are no longer using.Delete emails containing personal information that are no longer neededMake it a point to delete emails that contain confidential data.This includesany attachments you may have downloaded.If you use your mobile device toshare documents, practise the same care – whether you WhatsApp or snap aphotograph of somebody’s identity card, driver’s licence or other document.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and individuals sharing and exchanging files containing personal data andother confidential information should take the following precautionary measures:■■■■■Make sure that you and your organisation are permitted to use cloud storage services.Use cloud storage services and share documents and files only in accordance withprotocols set out in your organisation’s information security policy.Use protection measures such as two-factor authentication, password protection and/orencryption.Ensure that email addresses are correct and be stingy about who gets a copy of theemail.Think about whether copies should be sent using the “bcc” function rather thanthe “cc” function.Keep your shared documents and links up to date.Do regular housekeeping and deleteemails containing personal data when you no longer need them.1234Ponemon Institute “Breaking Bad: The Risk of Insecure File Sharing”, Oct 2014.Instructions for Dropbox users: https://www.dropbox.com/help/363Instructions for GoogleDrive users:

free touse?The data protection law invariably requires an organisation to obtain consentfrom individuals before collecting, using or disclosing their personal data.However, there are exceptions to the consent requirement.A typical exception relates to “publicly available information” or“publicly available data”.To illustrate, here is a list of some types ofpublicly available information:■■■Government and public sector agency records – for example, land titlerecords, company registration records (including details of directors andshareholders) and bankruptcy records.Information about listed public companies that they disclose to the publicin the company’s Annual Report and in their stock exchange filings.Forexample, they might disclose the remuneration of their directors and/orsenior executives.Videos and photos taken of individuals in places that are open to thepublic, even if it is necessary to buy a ticket or book a seat, for example.Note: Videos and photos taken of individuals at private functions held■■in public places where entry is by invitation only (such as a private roomin a restaurant or a restaurant that is booked out for a private function)are not publicly available information.Nor are videos made and photostaken from a public place looking into a place that is not open to thepublic (for example, looking from the street through the window of ahouse).Personal contact information of individuals who advertise in thenewspapers or on the Internet to offer products or services for sale or tosource for products or services to purchase.Personal details of individuals posted on social media platforms that arenot restricted to select groups of people.Is an organisation free to collect, use or disclose publicly availableinformation?The question one might ask is: “If consent of the individuals concerned is notrequired in the above scenarios, does it mean that anyone can have unfettereduse of such publicly available data?”The answer matters, particularly from a sales and marketing perspective.If the answer is “Yes”, rich sources of personal data are a marketer’sbonanza.Unfortunately, the answer is usually “It depends”.So access to publicly available data does not automatically give anorganisation or an individual the right to use or disclose such data in any waythey like.It seems to be better to err on the conservative side rather than tohave a complaint or even a lawsuit against the organisation.Some reasons why “It depends” follow.There may be additional reasonsin specific circumstances or concerning specific information.This is an areafor consideration on a case-by-case basis.Licensing or right-of-use considerationsThe organisation that publishes personal data may restrict its use.Forexample, where personal data is made available by a government or publicsector agency it may impose specific licensing or right-of-use conditions.These may include restricting use of purchased data to the individual orentity that purchases it and prohibiting any re-sale of the personal data to athird-party.Before using or disclosing any personal data that is publicly availableinformation, an organisation or individual must be sure to check forapplicable terms and conditions and make sure to comply with them.Intent of the individual who made their personal data available publiclyAn organisation has to be cognisant of the intent of the individuals who maketheir personal data publicly available.Individuals who advertise in thenewspapers to look for a vehicle with certain specifications might toleratesomeone offering them another vehicle with slightly different specificationsin response to their advertisement.But they would most likely not tolerate someone trying to sell them a spapackage or financial advice.Even though the data protection law may permitthe organisation to collect and use their personal data without consent forsales and marketing purposes, it will be futile and possibly counter-productive from a business perspective if the individual feels that theorganisation should not have done so.The law of unintended consequencesCare is always needed if images of individuals are used without theirknowledge and consent.There may be unexpected and unintendedconsequences and the organisation using the images might be responsible forthem.The use needs to be reasonable in the sense of being personallyacceptable to individuals if it is to win or retain their goodwill.For example,a group of people whose photo is taken at a public place would most likelybe annoyed if they discover that their photo is being used to promote a weightmanagement programme or a hair implant programme.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES■■Organisations should understand that they will not usually have the right to use ordisclose publicly available information indiscriminately.The use or disclosure of publicly available data should take into consideration:•••licensing or right-of-use requirementsthe intent of the data originatorthe law of unintended consequences 36",,,"do you or your organisation use cloud storage services such as Dropbox and Google Drive, which are

12,12,Identity verification – the right way,"I seem to have a “love affair” with banks and other credit card issuers.Everyso often I have to call their hotline to address some inaccuracies in myaccount statement, such as additional charges that I have not actuallyincurred, charges that are not waived despite agreement to waive them, andchanges that they have not made despite agreement to make them.In the past, every time I called the hotline, the customer service officer(CSO) at the other end would ask me three standard questions to verify myidentity: NRIC (National Registration Identity Card) number, date of birthand mobile phone number.Once these three pieces of information werechecked against the organisation’s records, I was able to discuss whatever Iwished regarding my account.In recent years, banks and other credit card issuers have tightened theiridentity verification processes.This is because they realise that it isrelatively easy to obtain the three pieces of information mentioned above.For example, individuals often provide them for lucky draws or when signingup for loyalty programmes.An additional question is now often asked by the banks and other creditcard issuers to verify a customer’s identity.For example, “How manyaccounts do you have with us?”, “How many supplementary cards do youhave on this account?”, “How many ATM (automated teller machine), creditand debit cards do you have with us?”,etc.How strict is your identity verification process?On one occasion, I was really stumped when I called a bank’s hotline toactivate the new chip-based ATM card the bank had sent to my homeaddress. “Which year did you open your account with the bank?”asked theCSO.I tried to reason with the CSO that I opened my account many years agoand my memory failed me.Patiently, the CSO tried to help me recall, by asking me: “Have you anyrecord of this kept somewhere?”When I said I did not, the CSO said to me:“I’m sorry, Sir, I can’t activate your new ATM card over the phone.You willneed to come to one of our bank branches with your new card, together withyour NRIC for identity verification, to have it activated.”Was I annoyed that I had to set aside some time to go to one of the bank’sbranches to have this simple procedure done?Absolutely not!On the contrary, I have confidence that this bank handles my personaldata with proper care.This is because it used stringent checks to verify myidentity, even to the extent of refusing its service to me over the phone.Thisbank has earned my trust in personal data protection.It has implemented thenecessary security measures and verification controls to protect the personaldata (both physical and electronic) under its care against:■■■unauthorised access and modification to the personal dataunauthorised use, disclosure or duplication of the personal data andloss of the personal data.And not only that, the bank has trained its staff well on how to deny access tothe bank’s services if the requester over the phone cannot pass the stringentidentity verification procedures.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES■■In verifying the identity of customers, an organisation should go beyond asking thestandard questions and include certain questions that are related to the customer’sunique dealings with the organisation.If customers answer the supplementary questions incorrectly, the organisation shoulddeny service to them until they can show documentary proof of their identity.42",,," Why have banks and other credit card issuers tightened theiridentity verification processes?

13,13,Hitting the “send” button and regretting it,"Your Honour, I plead guilty to the following offences that I committed byhitting the “send” button too quickly on my PC, laptop and mobile devices:■■■■■■I attached files containing personal data and other confidential data andsent it to the wrong addressee.It happened because I did not check theemail address that was “auto-filled” by the email software after I hadkeyed in the first two letters of the intended recipient’s name.When I forwarded an email to a colleague for information, I forgot todelete the earlier discussion thread.It contained highly sensitive personaldata that my colleague was not supposed to know.When I sent out an email announcement to a group of recipients I used the“cc” feature instead of the “bcc” feature on the email system.Thisresulted in numerous personal email addresses being exposed toeveryone on the mailing list.An unscrupulous recipient could easily“harvest” the email addresses for marketing purposes, or worse, for illintentions.I drafted an email message in anger.It had a harsh tone and unpleasantwords.I sent it out inadvertently instead of placing it in the “drafts”folder for me to edit later when my anger simmered down.I sent a text message from my smartphone to congratulate a friend on thenew addition to his family.It was disastrous.Because I didn’t check oneof the “auto-corrected” or “auto-completed” words my message wasunpleasant and inappropriate for the occasion.I bought duplicate items in an online shopping spree because I didn’tcheck the contents of the “shopping cart” thoroughly before I hit the“send” button.Like me, how many of you have hit the “send” button on your PC, laptop ormobile devices too quickly and regretted it later?I believe the number of youwho answer “yes” would be high.(By the way, it seems many individuals do not understand that the“recall” function in Outlook works only to recall emails within a network,such as within a corporate email network.Where you send an email to anoutsider and then try to recall it, all you do is to draw the recipient’s attentionto it.)Why we hit “send” and regret it laterWe hit “send” and regret it later because we live in a fast-paced,information-obsessed society today.We want to share information (or, dare Isay, gossip) and communicate our views to others quickly.With technologies that allow us to send messages on the move, anytimeand anywhere, we tend to multi-task – for example, composing and sendingtext messages while watching TV or waiting for the meat to be roasted.Because of the many other tasks we are doing concurrently, we tend to beless thorough in checking the correctness of our communication messagesbefore we hit the “send” button.How to prevent hitting the “send” button too quicklyHow can we stop being trigger-happy with the “send” button?Here are sometips:■ Turn off the “auto-suggest”, “auto-correct” and “auto-complete” featuresin your email and text messaging systems.There is a trade-off between convenience and the danger of errors.If■you want the convenience, you must be willing to spend the timenecessary to thoroughly check your emails and text messages beforehitting “send”.Adjust your email settings so that the default position is that wheneveryou forward an email the preceding discussion thread will not beincluded.Then, on a case-by-case basis, when you need to include thepreceding discussion thread with a forwarded email, change your emailsettings for that email.Also take the time to double-check whether thepreceding discussion thread is relevant to, or intended for, therecipient(s) to whom you are forwarding the email.After you have sentthe email change your settings back to the default position.(Some individuals who habitually handle personal data or other■■■confidential information adjust their email settings so that “reply” and“reply all” to an email do not include the email to which they arereplying either.They avoid disclosing personal data or other confidentialinformation accidentally, such as in those cases where they add anadditional individual to the recipient list.They also check who isincluded in the “cc” list in the email to which they are replying and deleteany individuals who do not need to be included in their reply.)Always use “bcc” instead of “cc” when you email a group of recipients.Make an exception only where you have concluded that it is importantthat all recipients know who else is receiving the same email.Remember to save draft emails or messages in the “drafts” folder untilyou have time to edit and send them out later.Compose and send out important and sensitive emails or text messageswhen you are more focused and less distracted by other simultaneoustasks.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIndividuals should exercise care before hitting the “send” button on their computingdevices:■■■■■Turn off the “auto suggest”, “auto-correct” and “auto-complete” features in your emailand text messaging systems.If you still want these conveniences, you have to dothorough checks before you hit the “send” button.Make sure that any preceding discussion thread that is not relevant to or not

15,15,Clean desk way to data privacy,"One can learn something about people by looking at their work desks.If thedesk is neat and tidy, the person tends to be organised.If the items on thedesk are well-aligned, the person tends to be organised, systematic andmeticulous.On the other hand, if the desk is messy, the person tends to bedisorganised and unstructured.But some of these “messy” people wouldargue that they are creative and non-linear in their thinking.I once had a colleague whose desk was the messiest I have ever seen.One could never see the surface of his desk.It was buried many layers deepwith papers, opened files, opened books and manuals, stationery items,empty coffee cups and other unidentified paraphernalia.One wondered howhe could ever find anything in this huge mess.Then one fine day, when hewas away on a one-week vacation, a few of us fellow colleagues decided totidy up his desk for him.We thought we were doing him a great favour.But,lo and behold, when he returned from leave, instead of thanking us, he wenton a rampage.The reason was he could not find anything.Somehow, in hisstate of messiness, he had a system to know exactly where he had placedwhat things.But I think he is more an exception than the norm.More oftenthan not, we hear people with messy desks complaining, “I can’t find this!Ican’t find that!”Why am I sharing all these anecdotes?From the information securitypoint of view, if you don’t have total visibility of what you own (such aspersonal data and other confidential documents), you may not know what ismissing.And if you can’t find what you have (such as your employee accesscard), it is as good as missing.And if you don’t clear all personal data and other confidentialinformation from your desk when you are absent for more than a few minutes,other individuals may be privy to it – your fellow employees during thebusiness day, and cleaners and perhaps other service providers overnight andon weekends.That is why expert practitioners of information security often cite a“Clean Desk Policy” as the recommended best practice.What is a “clean desk policy”?SANS Institute is a private U.S. for-profit company that specialises ininformation security and cyber security training.It says that a “clean deskpolicy” is:an important tool to ensure that all sensitive/confidential materialsare removed from an end-user workspace and locked away when theitems are not in use or when an employee leaves his/herworkstation .Elements of SANS Institute’s “clean desk policy”The main elements of the policy, as adapted from SANS Institute, are thefollowing:■■■■■■■■Employees are required to ensure that all sensitive/confidentialinformation in hardcopy or electronic form is secure in their work area atthe end of the day and when they are expected to be gone for an extendedperiod.Computer workstations must be locked when the workspace isunoccupied.Computer workstations must be shut down completely at the end of thework day.Any confidential or sensitive information must be removed from the deskand locked in a drawer when the desk is unoccupied and at the end of thework day.File cabinets containing confidential or sensitive information must bekept closed and locked when not in use or when not attended.Keys used for access to confidential or sensitive information must not beleft at an unattended desk.Laptops must be either locked with a locking cable or locked away in adrawer.Passwords must not be left on sticky notes posted on or under a computer,nor should they be left written down in an accessible location.■■■■■■Printouts containing confidential or sensitive information should beimmediately removed from the printer.Upon disposal, confidential and/or sensitive documents should beshredded in official shredder bins or placed in locked confidentialdisposal bins.Whiteboards containing confidential and/or sensitive information shouldbe erased.Portable computing devices such as laptops and tablets should be lockedaway at the end of the work day.Mass storage devices such as CD-ROMs, DVDs and USB drives must betreated as sensitive and must be secured in a locked drawer.All printers and fax machines should be cleared of papers as soon as theyare printed; this helps ensure that sensitive documents are not left inprinter trays for the wrong person to pick up.Some additional elements of a “clean desk policy”Here are some elements to add to the SANS Institute’s list:■■■Lock your computer screen when you leave your desk unattended, even iffor just a short while, with a password required to unlock it.Do not throw any documents with personal data or other confidentialinformation into the wastepaper basket.Do not leave any security devices (such as an employee access pass orbank security token) on your desk when you leave it unattended, even fora relatively short while.Clean desk, clear conscienceIt makes a lot of sense to have a “clean desk policy”.It minimises the risk ofpersonal data or other confidential information being misplaced, lost, oraccessed by unauthorised individuals.If all employees of an organisation conscientiously play by the rules ofthe “clean desk policy”, they can leave their workplace at the end of theworkday with a clear conscience.And the integrity of information securitypractices at the organisation is safeguarded.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES■■■Organisations should have a “clean desk policy” and ensure that their employees aretrained to understand it and abide by it.A “clean desk policy” minimises the risk of personal data or other confidential informationbeing misplaced, lost, or accessed by unauthorised persons.Every employee of the organisation should conscientiously play by the rules of the “cleandesk policy” to safeguard the integrity of the organisation’s information security practices.50",,," How did one see the surface of his desk?

17,17,"Open office, open invitation to snoop","Walk into any modern office and what is a common sight you behold?Alabyrinth of tightly compacted, adjoining cubicles.Each employee who is“resident” there can proudly call a small space their own private space.Thisopen-office concept is said to improve employee interaction and teamwork(although it has the benefit of maximising usage of expensive office realestate too).We have done many “onsite” audits for our consulting clients, walkingthrough our clients’ offices, to identity potential information security risks.Here are some tips from what we have learned during these audits:Office cubicle layoutsThe first thing we often notice is that employees from different departmentsof an organisation or employees working on different projects are seated incubicles next to each other.They can easily interact to collaborate and tosocialise.But they can also peer over cubicle walls to snoop at whether theircolleagues are working hard enough and to see what they are working on.Ineither case, employees of an organisation may inadvertently or deliberatelyview personal data and other confidential information on paper documents oron computer screens that they are not authorised to see.■■Organisations should configure their cubicle layouts so that:employees with the same “need to know” access to certain classes ofpersonal data and other confidential information are seated next to eachother andpreferably there is some physical separation from other employeeswithout that “need to know” access.Sometimes this is not possible, for example due to space constraints.In thatcase, the organisation must make a risk assessment and balance the costs ofsuch a layout against the risks of failing to comply with the data protectionlaw – personal data being disclosed to unauthorised individuals – that is, toemployees who do not have the “need to know”.In large part, an organisation might decide that the risk can be wellmanaged by training each employee to exercise “self-safeguarding” ofpersonal data and other confidential information.And then conducting regularaudits to ensure that they actually exercise such self-safeguarding.Someexamples of self-safeguarding include requiring employees to:■■■use special privacy filters on their computer screenskeep confidential documents covered in paper files andlock personal data and other confidential documents in drawers orcabinets when they are away from their desks.Highly confidential and sensitive information – good office configurationEmployees in Human Resource (HR) and Finance Departments typicallyhandle highly confidential and sensitive information.In some organisationstheir cubicles are in separate rooms, one room for the HR Department andanother for the Finance Department, for example.Entry to these dedicatedrooms is by means of special door access passes issued only to thoseemployees who work in the relevant department.This is a good practice for reducing the risk of non-HR Departmentemployees or non-Finance Department employees gaining unauthorisedaccess to highly confidential and sensitive information.However, thecomments above under the heading “Office cubicle layouts” continue toapply within the HR Department and the Finance Department – that is, not allHR Department employees and not all Finance Department employees havethe same “need to know” access to personal data and other confidentialinformation.We see in some organisations the HR Department and the FinanceDepartment housed in the same room, though separated from otheremployees.Again, the comments above under the heading “Office cubiclelayouts” apply to separating HR Department employees and the personal dataand other confidential information that they “need to know” from the FinanceDepartment employees.And vice versa.Highly confidential and sensitive information – when implementationdoesn’t quite workIn some organisations with separate rooms for the HR Department and theFinance Department, we see that the doors to these dedicated rooms are leftopen during office hours.This is typically because employees from otherdepartments may have to submit their medical certificates (MCs) to the HRDepartment or their expense claim forms to the Finance Department.We hearthat constant door opening and closing is inconvenient and disruptive to HRDepartment employees and Finance Department employees.In addition, the employee who is responsible for processing MCs orexpense claim forms is sometimes seated a long way from the door of the HRDepartment or Finance Department.Employees from other departments whocome to deliver MCs or expense claim forms have to walk through long rowsof cubicles to reach that particular person.They may chance upon personaldata or other confidential information on HR Department or FinanceDepartment employees’ desks – particularly if they stop for a chat with anHR Department employee or Finance Department employee along the way.Organisations should avoid this situation by making the HR Departmentand the Finance Department strictly out of bounds to employees from otherdepartments.This policy must be enforced.There should be a sign on thedoor to say “Access for Staff of XX Department only” so that otheremployees cannot plead ignorance.As far as practicable, other employees who wish to submit their MCs orexpense claim forms should do so by a one-way drop-in slot into a lockedcontainer, similar to that of a post-box.The slot should be narrow enough sothat no human hand can go in to retrieve any of the paper forms or documents.By locating the slot on the wall of the main entrance to the HR Department orthe Finance Department, other employees can simply drop in their MCs orexpense claim forms and need not enter the departmental office at all.Office securityWe have seen some organisations that have taken the open-office concept tothe extreme.It is so open that anyone who walks into the office premisesneed not sign in to the visitors’ book because there is no need to do so.Allthe person needs to do is to appear before the receptionist and ask to see so-and-so, and to wait at the waiting area for the so-and-so to appear.On paper, this looks like a reasonable practice.But, in reality, there isonly one receptionist on duty at any one time, and it is very easy for anystranger to bypass the receptionist and walk straight to any work desk(because all the doors are left open for the convenient movement of theinternal staff).And it is a piece of cake for the stranger to just take out anyconfidential document that is left lying around on desks of employees whohave stepped away for a moment.As its first line of defence, the organisation should have a locked doorbetween the reception/waiting area and the working area in its office.A“Restricted Access” or “Out of Bounds” sign displayed on the locked doormeans that there is no “I didn’t know” excuse if, somehow (such as tailgatingan employee), a visitor is able to enter the main office area.And of coursethe sign gives employees all the justification they need for telling any visitorthat they must not tailgate them.Handling information within the organisationIn an open office, it can be fairly easy for employees to have access topersonal data and other confidential information they are not authorised toknow.For example, salespersons could approach their colleagues from theFinance Department to get details of their latest commissions earned.In oneclient’s office we were told that top salespersons would sit next to theirFinance Department colleague, who would present them with the requestedinformation, either on the computer screen or in a hardcopy file.Thesesalespersons could peek at the information of other salespersons who weretheir competitors for top honours.The Finance Department employee shouldat least shield the information of the other salespersons.A better approach is for the Finance Department employee to ask thesalespersons to wait in the waiting area while they extract the requestedinformation for the particular salesperson and then bring it to them.Salespersons should not step into the Finance Department at all.Thismanages the risk of their seeing confidential information about theircompetitors or seeing any other personal data or other confidentialinformation held by the Finance Department.Handling information at public-facing areasIn an open office, if an organisation’s employees are not properly trained onthe do’s and don’ts of information security it can also be fairly easy foroutsiders to have access to personal data and other confidential informationthat they are obviously not authorised to see.For example, reception counter or service counter employees shouldensure that:■■■no paper documents are left exposed on the counterno paper documents are left exposed in in/out trays andcomputers are placed in such a way that information on screen is notwithin the line-of-sight of outsiders.Security guards monitoring CCTV cameras should ensure that their viewingscreens are positioned out of the line-of-sight of visitors who come to thesecurity counter to sign the organisation’s visitors’ book.Handling information in common areasIn an open office, the organisation should be careful not to display anypersonal data or other confidential information in common areas – that is,areas open to all of the organisation’s employees – if employees are notauthorised to know it.Here are some current practices we observed at our clients’ offices aswe conducted onsite audits:■ In one client’s office, there was a huge electronic screen in a commonarea displaying the performance data of every salesperson.The organisation’s intention was to challenge the salespersons toperform better.But the information was displayed to not only thesalespersons themselves but also viewable by other employees not fromthe Sales Department.How would the poorer performers feel?Such sensitive information should be kept within the four walls of the■Sales Department.In another client’s office, we found files containing confidentialinformation arranged neatly on open shelves in the meeting room.There was nothing to prevent individuals – whether outsiders oremployees not authorised to see it – from viewing the confidentialinformation in a file if they were alone in the room waiting for otherindividuals to arrive for a meeting.Such shelves should be covered with opaque panels that are locked so■that no unauthorised individual can see what is on them or take files outand look at them.In yet another client’s office, we found open pigeonholes withconfidential documents in files.These files could be flipped open easily.We also found sales commission slips of agents in unsealed envelopes.Organisations should replace open shelf-style pigeonholes withlocked letter boxes.They should have one-way slots and only the“owner” of the letter box should have a key to it.Information security consciousnessFrom an information security point of view, in an open office there are manyways that personal data and other confidential information may be seen byindividuals who are not authorised to see it.■■■■Organisations should:ensure that they are aware of the vulnerabilities and security gaps in theiropen officedevelop and implement policies and practices to minimise thevulnerabilities and gaps and train all employees to adhere to them“audit” their offices regularly by walking around and checkingcompliance with their existing policies and

additional requirements.An organisation should ensure that all employees are aware of theorganisation’s information security do’s and don’ts and make every effort tocarry out self-safeguarding of personal data and other confidentialinformation that they are handling.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and employees should practise the following to safeguardpersonal data and other confidential information in their offices:Office layout■■Require employees to practise self-safeguarding of personal data and other confidentialinformation under their care in an open-office concept.House employees handling highly confidential or sensitive information in separate roomswith locked doors and restricted access to other employees.Office security■■Require all visitors to report at the reception counter.Restrict visitor movement to the waiting area unless escorted by an employee.Handling information within the organisation■■Show only the personal data and other confidential information that is relevant to therequesting employee.Better still, make the requesting employee wait outside the confidential work area whilethe information is being extracted.Handling information at public-facing areas■■Do not leave confidential documents exposed at the reception counter, service counteror in/out trays.Shield computer screens from the line-of-sight of outsiders, including the terminals usedby security guards to monitor CCTV cameras.Handling information in common areas■■■Do not display confidential or sensitive information openly that is only pertinent to aparticular group of employees.Do not store confidential files on open shelves that are directly accessible to visitors.Do not place in open pigeonholes confidential files that can be easily flipped open orconfidential documents in unsealed envelopes.52",,," How can employees interact with each other?

18,18,Remember to clear out,"I recall that at the end of my university course many years ago I had to clearout all my personal belongings (including all the accumulated rubbish) frommy hostel room.The university expected me to return the room to its originalspartan state so that it would be ready for a new student to move in.I had tocomb through every nook and cranny of the room meticulously to ensure that Idid not leave behind a single item that belonged to me.Minimising information security incidentsThis recollection of my past set me thinking.Can this same “clear out”principle be applied to the way we treat information security?If everyone consciously remembers to clear out everything belonging tothem at the end of every life moment or work session, we might minimiseinformation security incidents.Some failures to “clear out”Here are some examples of failure to exercise the “clear out” principle inplaces where personal data or other confidential information has been usedor shared:■■■■Leaving a laptop computer or mobile phone behind at a public place suchas a shopping centre, restaurant or café, or leaving it behind in a taxi oron other public transportLeaving a USB drive or other portable hard disk behind at a sharedterminal in a common work areaLeaving behind paper files and documents at a public place or on publictransportDropping a security access pass on the way to some destination orleaving it behind at a public place■■■■■Forgetting to delete uploaded/downloaded confidential files or to emptythe recycle bin from a shared public terminal after using itForgetting to collect a confidential document from thephotocopier/scanner after photocopying/scanning the documentSending a confidential document to the printer and then forgetting tocollect the printoutForgetting to remove extra copies of confidential documents from themeeting room at the end of a meetingForgetting to erase the whiteboard or remove the flipcharts in a meetingroom at the end of a meetingWhat the organisation can do to help employees “clear out”Organisations should have clear policies and written practices assigningresponsibility for protecting personal data and other confidential informationto employees according to their job roles.These policies and practicesshould form part of their standard employment contract and there should bedisciplinary consequences for failure to comply with them.Organisations should then remind their employees to “clear out”.Oneway of doing this is by putting up signs near shared terminals in commonwork areas, at printers/photocopiers/scanners and in meeting rooms.If an employee fails to “clear out”, either by deliberately ignoring thesereminders or by carelessness, they will have to bear the resultingdisciplinary consequences.These could be particularly serious if there is anymisplacement or loss of personal data or confidential information under theircare.What employees should do to “clear out”Including policies and practices about information security in employmentcontracts and applying disciplinary consequences for failing to adhere tothem tend to focus employee minds.Training is an important ingredient too.This should instil in individuals the habit of conscientiously having amental or written checklist of what they have brought with them to thevarious places they work at or visit.The organisation cannot help individuals who leave their valuables andpersonal belongings behind in public places or on public transport.Theindividual must take responsibility.A mental or written checklist helps, butindividuals are solely responsible for their own negligence or carelessness.Individuals should always be aware of their surroundings and the risks,such as the risk of theft.They should take the necessary precautions againstplacing their belongings or anything containing personal data or otherconfidential information in unguarded positions that are tempting to thieves.Discipline to “clear out”The personal discipline of practising the “clear out” principle does not comenaturally to some people.The “clear out” principle has to be constantly nurtured and drilled intoindividual consciousness.Employees of an organisation quickly learn to “clear out” if there aredisciplinary consequences when they misplace or lose personal data or otherconfidential information in their possession or under their control.Anapproach that incorporates “clear out” and other information securitypolicies and practices into employment contracts may also mitigate anyregulatory penalties on the organisation for failing to comply with the dataprotection law.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should do the following to minimise loss or theft of personal data and otherconfidential information:■■■Remind their employees to adopt a “clear out” mentality so as to minimise the risk ofinformation security incidents occurring.Display signs prominently at shared terminals in common work areas, atprinters/photocopiers/scanners and in meeting rooms to remind employees to “clearout”.Include policies and practices on information security in employment contracts, withdisciplinary consequences for non-compliance.Individuals should have a mental or written checklist of what they have brought with them tothe various places they have visited or worked at, so that they know what to “clear out”.53",,," What did the university expect me to do?

22,22,Lock it or lose it,"Why do we consciously take pains to ensure our valuables at home are keptsecurely locked in strongboxes, drawers and cabinets, even though our frontand back doors are locked?Why is it that paper documents and files containing personal data andother confidential information are often NOT kept securely locked in filecabinets and drawers in offices?This is one of the most common findingswhen we audit our clients’ offices in the course of our consulting work.When we ask them why, these are some of the reasons we hear:■■■“We have space constraints.There is not enough room to put in additionalfile cabinets.Some of our files have to be placed into cardboard boxesbeneath our work desks.”“It is too tedious to unlock the file cabinets, take out the files we need touse, put them back into the cabinets after use and lock the cabinets.Wewould rather put the current files on our work desks or place them on theopen shelves.”“The main door to the office is locked after office hours or when no oneis around.So it should be secure enough.”These reasons seem legitimate enough, at least on the surface.But, becauseof the data protection law and because confidential information may bevaluable commercially, organisations should not be complacent.A laissez-faire approach risks the organisation losing or misplacingimportant files containing personal data or other confidential information.Ata minimum, organisations should do a risk assessment of the types ofconfidential information, including personal data, which should be protectedstrongly.A strong protection means that paper documents and files should bekept under lock and key around the clock.Examples of personal data and other confidential information requiring ahigher level of protection include:■■■■employees’ personnel files and performance appraisal reportspersonal information of high net worth individualsmarket-sensitive information andcustomer lists, contracts and other valuable business information.Lock and keyAn organisation should ensure employees make a conscious effort to lockthose file cabinets that ought to be locked.And to protect the keys used tolock them.Here is what we often observe in our onsite audits of clients:■ File cabinets are locked but the keys are left in the keyholes forconvenience – so that there is no need to hunt for them next time.■■■File cabinets are locked but the keys are taped to the top or the side of thecabinets, again for convenience.Keys are left in the keyhole.The locking mechanism is broken.File cabinets do not have a lock.KeypressAn organisation should maintain a secure keypress where all the keys can bekept safely.Keypress records should properly account for each key.Themaster key to the keypress must be assigned to a responsible person who isaccountable for its safekeeping.Here are some practices that we have observed in our client audits.Theyare not acceptable in a good information security programme:■■■No one is accountable for the master key.It is left in the keypress.Therefore, anyone has access to the keys in the keypress.The master key to the keypress has been misplaced, so the keypress is notlocked (or cannot be locked).There is no record of the movement of keys.No one knows whether somekeys are lost.No one knows if someone has taken a key out of thekeypress – or when they took it out – and not returned it.So employeeswho are not authorised to see personal data or other confidentialinformation may actually have unfettered access to it and no one knows!In some organisations, guess who has access to the master key – the cleaner!The reason is simple: the cleaner arrives at the office first to unlock thedoors and do the cleaning, and is the last to leave the office after clearing therubbish for the day.Little do these organisations realise the risks to which they are exposingpersonal data and other information in their possession or under their control(albeit in some organisations the security guards follow the cleaner around).What better way to steal an organisation’s secrets than to pose as a cleanerand be handed the master key to the keypress.Classification and inventoryOther areas of concern we usually observe and highlight to our clients are:■ Files are not classified into categories such as “Confidential”,“Restricted Access” and “Public”.Employment contracts should require employees to protect theorganisation’s confidential data.But if files are not classified, anyonecaught with, or misusing, information that the organisation considers to beconfidential can easily plead ignorance.They can thus use this as anexcuse to avoid the consequences of breaching their employmentcontract.Data protection policies and practices should restrict access to■personal data, as well as confidential information.If files are notclassified, anyone who accesses files containing personal data eitheraccidentally or deliberately can similarly plead ignorance.Again, theycan use this as an excuse to avoid the consequences of failing to complywith the organisation’s data protection policies and practices.There is no inventory list of files kept in the cabinets – no one will be thewiser if a file is misplaced, lost or stolen.Concluding remarksLocking file cabinets, classifying files and maintaining file inventories toprotect an organisation’s valuable paper documents may be administrativelyinconvenient or burdensome for its employees.Locking strongboxes, drawersand cabinets and locking our doors at home may also be inconvenient too, butwe do it to protect our own valuables.If an organisation is serious about protecting its valuable paperdocuments it should require its employees to bear with administrativeinconveniences or burdens to help it achieve that aim.As the title of thischapter says, “Lock it or lose it”.It is better for the organisation to be safe,even at the expense of employees being inconvenienced, than to be sorry.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should implement the following practices to protect their documentscontaining personal data and other confidential information:■■■Ensure that their employees make a conscious effort to lock the file cabinets when theyare not around.Have a secure keypress where all the keys can be kept safety and for which a properaccounting is maintained.The master key to the keypress must be assigned to aresponsible person who is accountable for its safekeeping.Classify paper documents and files according to the level of confidentiality and maintainan inventory of documents and files that are kept in their filing cabinets.57",,," What risks the organisation losing or misplacingimportant files containing personal data or other confidential

23,23,"Out of sight, out of mind","What do organisations do when they have more paper documents and filesthan they have space enough to store them?I have observed how some organisations, especially small and mediumenterprises, come up with ingenious ways to create extra storage space.Hereare some examples:■■Put the less-current paper documents and files into cardboard boxes andstash them away on top of file cabinets, in the printing room, under workdesks or even in the tools storeroom.Have files from different departments share the same storage space.Larger organisations with bigger budgets invest in compactus-style cabinetsand filing systems to maximise the limited storage space.Some send out theirarchived documents and files to commercial warehouses offsite.Onsite storageWhere organisations store their paper documents and files onsite, do they:■■think about whether the manner or place in which they are stored couldgive rise to personal data and other confidential information beingaccessed by employees without a “need to know” or even by individualsfrom outside the organisation?Orworse, after some time, forget what is in the cardboard boxes and wherethey are kept?Here are some ways organisations might address these two concerns:■ Segregate those files with higher levels of confidentiality and sensitivityfrom the rest of the organisation’s files.For example, an organisationmight assess that the personnel files of ex-employees and (if theorganisation has a business or legal reason for needing to retain them) therésumés of unsuccessful job applicants attract higher levels ofconfidentiality and sensitivity than other files.Even if these files and documents have to be kept in cardboard boxes■and placed on top of file cabinets, the organisation should require thatthey are at least placed within the Human Resource (HR) Department.The organisation should require the HR Department to mark the boxes as“Confidential” and to ensure that only HR employees with a “need toknow” (as opposed to all HR employees) can have access to these filesand documents.The job titles of such individuals (for example, Directorof HR and Assistant Director of HR) should be clearly marked on theboxes so that other employees without a “need to know” will not open theboxes accidentally.Other departments responsible for storing their cardboard boxes of filesand documents in various nooks and corners should have the boxesclearly marked with the names of the departments that own them and witha “Confidential” notification.This is so that employees from otherdepartment will not open the boxes accidentally.Again, marking the boxes with the job titles of individuals with a■“need to know” might help to avoid other employees without a “need toknow” opening the boxes accidentally.As far as possible, files from different departments should not be put inthe same storeroom, especially where files contain personal data andother confidential information that is highly sensitive.For example, HR Department files and Finance Department filesshould not be co-located in the same space.If there is no choice, due to space constraints, then a deliberatedemarcation should be made so that employees from either department donot cross the line (for example, Shelving Unit A is for the HR Departmentand Shelving Unit B is for the Finance Department).In any case, the boxes should be marked as indicated above.■ An organisation should maintain a written inventory of what is containedin each box and where it is stored. (This should include documents storedoffsite, such as by attaching the separate records of them to theinventory.)This is because an organisation cannot expect anyone in theorganisation to remember these details after some time.Where there isseldom a need to refer to non-current files in the boxes it is even harderto rely on anyone’s memory.■ An organisation is required by the data protection law to dispose ofpersonal data when it is no longer necessary for a legal or businesspurpose.If possible, organise the files in each box according to the retentionperiod so that when it comes to dispose of them it is easier to locate theright boxes.Storage at warehouseSome organisations send their archived paper files and documents forstorage at offsite warehouses.From the perspective of the data protectionlaw the organisation remains responsible for them, although the warehouseoperator may have some statutory responsibilities too.The organisation should ensure that the responsibilities and obligationsof the warehouse operator are clearly spelt out in the storage contract withthe warehouse operator, which may include defined service levels.Suchresponsibilities and obligations should include those things that thewarehouse operator must do or must not do to enable the organisation toremain in compliance with the data protection law.Ideally, the agreement between the organisation and the warehouseoperator should include a contractual indemnity covering any costs, losses ordamage suffered by the organisation as a result of a breach of the agreementby the warehouse operator.This should extend to any misplacement, loss of,or damage to, the cartons of documents placed by the organisation at thewarehouse.It should also cover any other action or inaction by thewarehouse operator that may result in the organisation failing to comply withthe data protection law.Again, an organisation should maintain written records of the paper filesand documents that are stored at warehouses so that:■■the organisation can ensure that it disposes of, or destroys, these paperfiles and documents appropriately at the expiry of the retention periodsapplicable to them andthese paper files and documents may be accounted for in inventoryrecords lest they become forgotten – “out of sight, out of mind”.Concluding remarksThe volume of paper documents and files maintained by organisations isexpected to grow as their businesses expand.Storage space will never beenough.Organisations should do housekeeping regularly to dispose of thosedocuments that are no longer needed for any business or legal purpose, inaccordance with the organisation’s document retention policy.The more documents an organisation keeps, the more personal data theorganisation must protect, and the more the more the organisation’semployees have to remember where the documents are stored.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESFor storage of confidential documents onsite, organisations should adopt the followingpractices:■■■■Segregate files with higher levels of confidentiality/sensitivity from the rest.Mark storage boxes clearly with the owners’ names to prevent accidental opening bypersons without a “need to know”.Do not keep files from different departments in the same storeroom.Maintain an inventory record of the contents of each box and where it is stored.For storage of confidential documents at warehouse, organisations should adopt thefollowing practices:■■Spell out clearly the responsibilities and obligations of the warehouse operator in theservice level agreement, including indemnity clauses.Maintain an inventory record of the contents of each box and the document retentionschedule.60",,," What types of organisations come up with ingenious ways to create extra storage space?

24,24,Do you do regular email housekeeping?,"I recall in the early 1980s when computer memory was very expensive,having 1 MB (one million bytes) of storage in the hard disk was a luxury.Wehad to be very stingy when we used computer memory.We had to constantlydebate with ourselves which e-files to keep and which to delete.This applied to email usage too.We had a strict quota of memory spaceallocated to us by the IT Department.Again, deciding which emails to keepand which to delete was tough as we had the tendency to treat almost everyemail as important.Data and email housekeeping was a conscientious effortin those days.Today, the prices of computer memory have plummeted so much that weare no longer awed by gigabytes (109 bytes) of storage in tiny memory sticksor USB drives, or terabytes (1012 bytes) of storage in portable hard disks.Email systems like Gmail and Yahoo Mail provide allocated memory spacein the order of gigabytes.Many users now assume that the storage space willnot run out on them and are doing little or no housekeeping of their data filesand emails.Importance of emails to organisationsToday, emails have gone beyond their original use as a convenient andefficient mass communication tool.Organisations and employees use theemail system as a platform for brainstorming, sharing ideas, evaluatingproposals and even decision-making.There is now a ton of valuable information embedded in emails and theirattached files, comprising both company proprietary information as well aspersonal data and other confidential information of employees andcustomers.Such information in emails can be forwarded to individuals bothwithin and outside the organisation easily, thus rendering emails a vulnerablesource of information leakage.With little or no disciplined housekeeping ofemails, there could be gigabytes of information residing in the personal emailaccounts of employees that have passed their retention periods.And whathappens to such information when employees resign and leave theorganisation?What should organisations do?Faced with these twin challenges of safeguarding against information leakageand managing data retention in email systems, what should organisations do?Organisations should implement policies and processes to address atleast the following:■ Have a strict data and email housekeeping regime.It should seek toensure that employees make a conscientious effort to delete those e-filesor emails that are no longer needed.Some organisations have reverted to the old practice of allocating afixed quota of memory space to employees so that they have no choicebut to do regular housekeeping.Other organisations have taken the more draconian approach of■automatically deleting emails that are more than xx days old or emailaccounts to which the relevant employee has not logged in for more thanyy days.Mandate important e-files and email attachments to be deposited in acentral shared drive.This makes it is easier to manage the retentionschedules of these e-documents.A central shared drive also ensures that the organisation has access tothe e-documents of ex-employees.Some organisations do not allow file attachments in emails.Insteadthey allow hyperlinks only to the relevant e-documents in the shareddrive.The consequence is that only employees can gain access to e-documents.Even if the emails are leaked, the unauthorised recipientcannot access the e-documents in the shared drive.Final WordRegular data and email housekeeping is everyone’s responsibility.Organisations must constantly drum into their employees the need to doregular housekeeping and remind them of the risks of not doing so.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should be aware of the importance of emails and should adopt the followingpractices:■■■■Be aware that emails present a vulnerable source of information leakage if not properlymanaged.Understand that emails and their attachments, when retained by individual employees,have implications on the retention schedules of e-documents.Implement a strict data and email housekeeping regime for employees to delete e-files oremails conscientiously when they are no longer needed.Mandate that important e-files and email attachments are to be deposited in a centralshared drive so that it is easier to manage their retention schedules.68",,," What did Gmail and Yahoo Mail provide allocated memory space?

25,25,Beware of your laptop or home computer,"These days most people have at least one computer at home, either a laptopor a desktop computer.Sometimes more than one member of the family usesit to surf the Internet, to store their photos, to send emails to friends andrelatives and to download and play games.Sometimes a member of thefamily uses it for work purposes too, to store documents related to their workand to send work emails, for example.Many employees of organisations use their home computer for workpurposes sometimes.Those who are mobile workers, such as real estatesales people, financial advisers, freelancers and individuals who work fromhome, almost always use a home computer for work purposes.If you useyour home computer for work purposes you will have personal data andother confidential information in the work documents you store on it and inthe work emails you send and receive from it.The data protection lawrequires organisations to use reasonable measures to protect personal data.This includes personal data on a home computer.Or to put it another way, donot think that there is no need to protect personal data because it is not on anoffice computer.If you use your home computer only for personal or domestic purposesthe data protection law likely does not apply to you.But protecting theinformation on your home computer is still a good idea.You want tominimise the risk of someone hacking into it and destroying information onyour hard disk or stealing information and releasing it publicly.You should consider the following checklist for your home computer.Ifthe answer to any of the following questions is “no”, you should takeremedial actions immediately.Five questions about your home computer■■■■■Are you the only individual who uses the home computer? (Hint: theanswer is “yes” only if you never allow someone else to use your homecomputer, so for most people the answer is “no”.)Is your home computer password-protected?Does your home computer have a firewall installed and is the firewallturned on?Have you installed anti-virus software on your home computer and is itup to date?Are the documents on your home computer protected and backed-up?Using your home computerIn our security audits of real estate agents and financial advisers, forexample, we often notice that they share the same computer with theirchildren at least some of the time.Even if they do not allow the children todownload or play games on their computer, there are always school projectsand homework assignments where they need to use a computer.The danger is that your children or other family members who use thesame home computer as you do might accidentally leak personal data orconfidential documents connected with your work.And malware might findits way into your computer when they browse the Internet, install newapplications or read emails.Malware can cause a data breach.■■■Here are some tips to reduce the risk:Create a separate account for each person who shares your homecomputer.Separate your home-related documents and emails from your office work.It may make sense for you to create two separate accounts for yourself –one for work and the other for everything else.As an added precautionary measure, you might want to separate yourGoogle accounts1.Password-protecting your home computerYou should always protect your computer, including your home computer andparticularly your laptop (because it is more likely to be lost), fromunauthorised access.This does not mean that you do not trust other family members.It simplymeans that password-protecting your computer is a good security practice.And it protects your data from other visitors, such as people who come toyour home to provide various services, such as cleaning, air-conditionerservicing and general maintenance.Oh, and password protection shouldinclude a screensaver password for those times when you leave yourcomputer unattended.Password protection sounds very basic, right?Not true, based on ourfindings during security audits we have done for our clients.Even if there is a password, guess what it is?You’re right, it’s either“123456” or “password”.According to Splashdata, these two were the toppasswords in both 2014 and 2015.2 And that’s what we have found duringour security audits too.Plus we often find passwords written on yellowsticky notes and pasted to the computer monitor or under the keyboard.You should protect your home computer, including your laptop, with astrong password – not just a password, but a strong password.So if you loseyour laptop or if someone otherwise gets unauthorised access to your homecomputer they cannot get access to the personal data you have stored on it.If you are a mobile worker, data on your computer might include personaldata like transactions with clients and commissions.If you fail to takereasonable measures to protect it, you could be fined for failing to complywith the data protection law.In the US in April 2013 a property management firm was fined $15,000after the theft of a company laptop containing the personal data of over 600Massachusetts residents.3 The reason for the fine?The user did not even havethe basic password protection!So if your home computer, including your laptop, is not alreadypassword-protected you should make remedying this a priority.You caneasily find out online how to do it.4Is a firewall installed and turned on?A firewall is software or hardware that checks information coming from theInternet or a network.A firewall either blocks information from coming toyour computer or allows it to pass through to your computer, depending onyour firewall settings. (All computers have this as a standard installation, butcheck to make sure it has not been removed from your computer by someonewho found it inconvenient.)Firewall settings are intended to help prevent hackers or malicioussoftware (such as worms) from gaining access to your computer through anetwork or the Internet.A firewall can also help stop your computer fromsending malicious software to other computers.Make sure the firewallsettings on your home computer are turned on and active.Again, it is easy tofind information online about how to do this.5Do note that a firewall isn’t the same thing as an anti-virus program.Tohelp protect your home computer, you need both a firewall and an anti-virus/anti-malware program – which is the next point.Have you installed anti-virus software and is it up to date?Anti-virus software is not expensive compared with the value of theinformation stored on most home computers. (Even if your photos have nomonetary value, they are valuable to you, right?You would hate to lose themall.)And if you store work documents and emails on your home computer,they almost certainly have a monetary value from your perspective.Anti-virus software comes bundled with most new computers, but itexpires.You should check the expiry date to find out if the anti-virussoftware on your home computer has expired.We do see individuals who areconfident that they are protected by anti-virus software (because they see theicon in their toolbar), but they are wrong because the protection has expired.If you find anti-virus software too expensive to buy, including to extendor renew anti-virus software that came bundled with your computer, there isanti-virus software you can download from the Internet for free.6 (If you takethis route, check to satisfy yourself that the free product is adequate for yourneeds.)Ensure you scan your computer for viruses regularly.When was yourcomputer last scanned?Do yourself a favour, do it now!And check to see ifyour anti-virus software has an option for a regular auto-scan schedule.If so,set the regular schedule right after you do a scan now.Protecting your documents and backing them upProtecting your documents is your last line of defence.Even yourspreadsheets, presentations and PDF documents can be protected.You caneasily find information online about how to protect them – it depends on thesoftware you use and the type of document, but it is usually quite easy to do.7Note: You will need to remember the passwords or you will not be ableto gain access to the respective documents again!And when you send password-protected files to your business contacts orclients, never send the password in the same email (or other medium forsending the document).The email can be forwarded to another person.Theywill immediately see that password – which defeats the purpose of having apassword!Always take care to stop and think about what you are doing andwhat the recipient of your document might do – it is scary to know what somepeople do out of ignorance or inattention.Here is a tip about protecting images.We know that mobile workers, inparticular, find it very convenient and efficient to take photos of identitycards, application forms and even contracts using their smartphone camera.You cannot protect images in the same way as you can protect documents,spreadsheets, presentations and PDFs.But what you can do is to:■■paste them into a Word or PowerPoint document and password-protectthat document orpaste them into a document and convert that document into a PDFdocument – not many people seem to know that as you save the documentcontaining the image using the PDF format you can click on options togive you the ability to encrypt the file with a password.Password protection is particularly important if you are sending and sharingdocuments that include personal data or other confidential information,especially in the cloud (for example, in Dropbox).If anyone hacks into youraccount, your documents should still be safe from harm if you have usedstrong protection.Go ahead, try it.Make it a point to always protect documents that containpersonal data or other confidential information! (Of course, you shouldalways protect physical documents as well.)Others might ridicule you forbeing over-protective when sending documents with passwords. (Nothingever goes wrong, right?Wrong.And you don’t want to be the person whogets caught out.)Clients might wonder why you are doing this.Here’s your chance to buildup trust with them by showing that you do carefully protect their personaldata.And you might also share with them the importance of complying withthe data protection law too.Suffering a data breach may be a failure to comply with the dataprotection law that results in a fine or other consequences.You may also losethe trust of your clients.A final word while we are on the subject of protecting documents in yourhome computer.Do not forget to back them up regularly too.Someindividuals rely on storing a copy of their documents “in the cloud” using acommercially available cloud solution; others buy various types of portablestorage devices.Some individuals do both.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIndividuals should take the following precautionary measures when using their computersor laptops for storing and processing personal data and other confidential information:■■■■■■When you use your home computer for work purposes, do not allow your children todownload or play games on it.This is to prevent accidental leakage of personal data orconfidential documents connected with your work or the introduction of malware.Protect your home computer or your laptop from unauthorised access with a strongpassword.Ensure that a firewall is installed, turned on and is the latest version.Install anti-virus software and ensure it is up to date.Protect your documents, spreadsheets, presentations and PDF files with passwords ifthey contain personal data, and ensure you have back-ups.Embed images containing personal data into a Word document or PowerPointpresentation and save them with the built-in password.1234567You can find out online how to do so.See, for example,http://www.pcworld.com/article/2597432/three-easy-ways-to-separate-work-and-play-on-the-same-pc.html and, for Macs, http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-set-up-multiple-user-accounts-on-os-x/For the full list, see https://www.teamsid.com/worst-passwords-2015/ or numerous othersimilar lists that you will find if you Google for “worst passwords”.http://www.realtor.org/articles/property-management-firm-pays-15000-fine-following-data-breachSee, for example, http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/protect-computer-with-password#1TC=windows-7 and, for Macs, https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202860See, for example, http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-windows-firewall-on-off#turn-windows-firewall-on-off=windows-7 and, for Macs, https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642See, for example, http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388652,00.asp and, for Macs,http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-free-antivirus-software-for-mac/See, for example, http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/password-protect-pdf/ aboutpassword-protecting PDF documents in various formats.If your budget is tight, you mightconsider password-protecting PDFs by uploading them https://www.pdfprotect.net.69",,," What does a member of the family use it for?

26,26,Don’t be social engineered!,"Today, the term “social engineering”, as used in the context of informationsecurity, has taken on a very different meaning from its originalconceptualisation.One definition is:Social engineering is a non-technical method of intrusion used bycomputer hackers or cyber-criminals that relies heavily on humaninteraction and often involves tricking people into breaking normalsecurity procedures .1How do social engineers work?Social engineers use a variety of methods to trick unsuspecting individualsinto disclosing their personal data and other confidential information (such astheir identity card number, password, bank account number or payment cardnumber).They use social engineering to get the information necessary forthem to be able to gain illegal access to confidential databases or to carry outunauthorised transactions.In this chapter I will share from my personal encounters a few methodsthat are commonly used by social engineers.In all of them, the socialengineer does something to impersonate, or to masquerade as, genuineorganisations or individuals.Data verification over the phoneI received a phone call from a sweet voice at the end of the line saying thatshe (it is usually a female “bait”) was from ABC Bank and that the bank wasdoing a data verification exercise.It sounded legitimate enough since I was a customer of ABC Bank.Herfirst question was to verify whether she was speaking to “<my name>”.Iconfirmed positively as asking the question portrayed professionalism on herpart.Then she asked me for my bank account number.Immediately mydefensive “antenna” stood on end.I threw the question back at her, “If yousay you are from ABC Bank, how come you don’t know my bank accountnumber?”There was a long pause at the end of the line as she did not expect thiskind of response.Then her voice came back again, less confident now,saying, “Oh, never mind”, and she quickly terminated the call.Had I blurted out my bank account number to her, I could have risked mybank account being accessed illegally by a social engineer or anyunscrupulous person.Password verification onlineI tried to log in to one of my web-based subscription accounts with my userID and password.I was surprised to be greeted with this message:Your account has been reset.You have to re-enter your password .This had never happened to me before.And I did not request for my accountto be reset.Immediately I became suspicious and decided to check out the actualURL of the web portal.The URL turned out to be an unknown name with a“.com” behind it.Obviously someone had masqueraded as the real contentservice provider to acquire subscribers’ passwords.Had I not been alert enough I could have been deceived into giving awaymy password to a social engineer.Official commercial company correspondenceI received an email from PayPal with the subject header “Unauthorised Useof Your PayPal”.The email said:We’ve completed investigation on your account and havediscovered an instance of unauthorised account activity.Someonerecently tried changing sensitive Credit Card information on youraccount.Thus we have Limited Your Account, Kindly Verify yourinformation .This was followed by a clickable button that said “Check Now”.This immediately aroused my suspicion as my PayPal account had beendormant for quite some time.I did a quick investigation and found out thatalthough the sender’s name said “PayPal”, a simple “mouse over” revealedthat the actual name was something else – nothing resembling PayPal at all.So I had the good sense not to click on the button that said “Check Now”.As I scrolled further down the email, I made an amazing discovery.Therewas a paragraph in small print instructing one on “How do I know that this isnot a fake email?”The first line after this header read:An email really coming from PayPal will address you by your firstand last names or your business name .But the reality of this was that the email did exactly the opposite of what itsaid it would do – it did not address me by first name and last name at all,just to “undisclosed recipients”!What a neat and clever trick to make theemail look so authentic!Had I not been alert, I would have easily fallen preyto this social engineer’s trick.Official government correspondenceI received an email from the local tax authority.The sender’s email addresslooked like it was a legitimate tax authority email address.The email said:Attached is a report on your 2013 tax refund, we need you to gothrough the pdf attachment to view the tax refund report.Kindlyadvise your decision regarding this Tax Return Report forimmediate processing.Thank you .The email was signed off by the local tax authority, followed by the fulladdress of this government organisation and its correct website address.In summary, the email was from an official government organisation andeverything checked out – the full name and address of the local tax authority,its website address and its email address were all correct.The content of theemail looked perfectly legitimate.Just as I was about to click the pdf attachment, a gnawing feeling insideme compelled me to read through the email again.I read through the email asecond time, this time slowly and one word at a time.Then I made twostartling discoveries: the subject header of the email read “Your 2013 TaxReturn Report!!!”and the opening word in the email was “Hello”.I immediately smelled a rat as a genuine government tax authority wouldnot have used three exclamation marks in the subject header and would nothave addressed a taxpayer so casually with the salutation “Hello”.Sure enough this email turned out to be a hoax when I called the officialhotline of the local tax authority to verify it.Had I not been vigilant, in my haste to clear the numerous emails in myinbox I would have been “conned” into disclosing my personal and sensitivedata to such a sophisticated social engineer.Hijacking an email accountEarly one morning, I received email messages from four of my friends on thesame subject, “Cheap PCs Going Fast!”.When I opened these emails, threeout of four of my friends asked me whether I was satisfied with the purchaseof my new PC.Puzzled, I scrolled down the email and, to my great surprise,discovered that I had sent out an email to an undisclosed number of myfriends, recommending them to take advantage of the cheap PC offers!Theemail did not originate from me.Obviously my email account had been “hijacked” and someone hadmasqueraded as me to send out emails to my friends from my address book.I had read before that one’s email account could be “hijacked” bysomeone else, who would then impersonate the genuine person and send outemails in that person’s name.Such “hijackings” often occur when oneaccesses a public WiFi network or makes use of an unprotected publicterminal.The simple solution is to change the password of one’s email account.Iquickly changed my password and the scam was nipped in the bud.Fortunately, the scam email was on a tame subject like cheap PCs.What if someone had masqueraded me and sent out scam emails that wereunpleasant or provocative, which could put me in a bad light?How to protect against social engineers?As can be seen in the five personal encounters I had with social engineers,they primarily work on deception.They trick unsuspecting individuals intobelieving that the emails or phone calls they receive are from genuineorganisations.Some of these emails seem so authentic, such as the PayPaland tax authority anecdotes, that they can easily fool many people.Therefore, online users especially have to be vigilant at all times and beaware of what are some of the prevention and verification techniques theycan use.■Here I offer some advice based on my personal experience:Turn on the spam filter in your email account to filter out unwantedemails.This is not a fool-proof method as certain unwanted emails may stillget through while certain emails you want may be filtered out.But it isbetter to have a spam filter turned on than turned off.Today’s smart filterscan be trained to recognise new types of spam messages.When an email looks dubious or suspicious (for example, there is nosubject header or there are words spelt wrongly), don’t open it or clickon the attachment.Social engineers often make use of click buttons or file attachments todownload malware, spyware, Trojan horses or viruses into yourcomputer system.Verify the authenticity of the email sender by doing a simple “mouse■■over” if the sender is unfamiliar to you or seems suspicious.Verify the authenticity of the website URL if you suspect something isamiss.You can do this by retrieving the URL information from Page Info> Security under the Tools tab (Mozilla Firefox), Properties under thePage tab (Internet Explorer), or View Source under the More Toolsoption (Google Chrome).Examine the writing style or tone of language, especially for emails fromofficial government or known commercial company sources.You should be suspicious if the words used are too casual (for■■example, “Hello”) or the text contains a number of grammatical errors.If you have no dealings with an organisation for a long time, you shouldbe suspicious if, out of the blue, they ask you for verification of certainpersonal information.Do not disclose any personal data or other confidential information overthe phone if the caller should already know it. (If you initiate the call, the■organisation will of course need to verify your identity.)Be careful when you connect your computing device to a public WiFinetwork or if you use an unprotected public terminal.Be especially wary if you are asked to reset some settings on yourdevice or email accounts.Change your passwords often, particularlyafter you have recently connected to a public WiFi network or used apublic terminal.Social engineers are always on the prowl for unsuspecting victims.The bestdefence against them is to stay alert and vigilant at all times.You should alsoarm yourself with knowledge and awareness of what to watch out for,especially when you are using email or online services.Protecting one’spersonal information is one’s responsibility.Better to be safe than sorry.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and individuals should take the following precautionary measures tosafeguard against becoming victims of “social engineers”:■■■■■■■■Turn on the spam filter in your email account to filter out unwanted emails.Do not open an email or click on an attachment when it looks suspicious or dubious.Verify the authenticity of the email sender.Verify the authenticity of the URL on the web.Watch out for writing style or tone of language in emails – too casual, poor grammar.Be careful when an organisation asks you to verify certain personal information out of theblue.Do not disclose any personal data over the phone if the caller should already know ofsuch information.Be careful when you connect your computing device to public WiFi networks or makeuse of unprotected public terminals; change your passwords often.1Source: TechTarget 72Think that you will never be a victim of",,," What is a non-technical method of intrusion used by computer hackers?

27,27,A-tearing we will go,"Here is an easy exercise that is guaranteed to improve your left-right handcoordination and strengthen your wrist and finger muscles.It does not requireany brain power and is therapeutically soothing after a hard day’s work ofburning up your brain cells and staring at the computer screen.I’m not talking about massage.Rather, it is tearing papers, especiallythose that contain personal data and other confidential information you do notwant others to see.Merely tearing papers can get you into trouble under thedata protection law if the personal data printed on them is still partiallyreadable.Use paper shredders and secure document disposal servicesIn our work with our clients, one of the common sights we have observed inour onsite data protection audits is hand-torn papers in wastepaper baskets.When we ask employees why they do this, they invariably give one of thefollowing answers:■■“We don’t have a paper shredder.”“The paper shredder is too far away – it is more convenient this way justfor a few pieces of paper.”But do they realise that people can easily piece the document back togetherby retrieving the torn pieces from the wastepaper basket?If the individualwho pieces back a document is not authorised to see the personal data theorganisation will likely have failed to comply with the data protection law.Ifso, the organisation risks fines and other penalties imposed by the regulator.■■At a minimum, organisations should:invest in paper shredders to destroy unwanted documents containingpersonal data and other confidential information orif they find it too time-consuming and tedious to do the shreddingthemselves, engage a commercial secure document disposal service to doit for them.Engaging a secure document disposal serviceA good – which is not necessarily the cheapest! –commercial securedocument disposal service provider leaves a secure, locked bin with a one-way slot for dropping in unwanted documents at their client’s premises.When the bin is full, the service provider carts the whole bin away andleaves a new empty one in its place.The service provider destroys thepapers inside the bins at its secure disposal facility.Once that is completed,the service provider issues the client a certificate of destruction.When selecting a service provider, make sure that the lid of the binprovided cannot be opened easily.It defeats the purpose of the securedisposal service if people can put their hands into the bin and retrieve piecesof paper with personal data or other confidential information on them.In addition, before engaging the service provider, make sure that it willactually destroy the papers and will certify that it has done so.Make sure thatthe service provider is reputable and that it is reasonable for the organisationto rely on its certificate of destruction.Why?Because we have heard ofinstances where a service provider promises that it will securely dispose ofdocuments but, in fact, sells as many sheets of paper as possible to readybuyers.The equation is simple.Money received by selling paper plus costssaved by not disposing of it securely equals more profit for the serviceprovider.Oh, and be sure to keep a record of the steps the organisation takesto satisfy itself on these points.If there is ever a problem later, evidence ofthe organisation’s “due diligence” on the service provider may beinvaluable.In-house shreddingIf, due to cost or other issues, an organisation prefers to shred the unwantedpapers in-house, here are three precautionary measures:■ Invest in a shredder with fine blades so that the resulting strips of papercannot be easily pieced back together.Or invest in a “crosscut” or othertype of shredder where it is virtually impossible to piece back thedocument, particularly where documents contain sensitive personal dataor highly confidential information.■ If employees are too busy to use the shredder, do not pile the unwantedpapers next to the shredder.Where papers are piled next to the shredder, employees or other■individuals walking past it can easily pick up a piece of paper from thepile and view the personal data or other confidential information on it.Beware of employees who are too busy to use the shredder and, perhapsknowing that they must not pile unwanted papers next to the shredder,dump them into the bin inside the shredder.These employees might genuinely think that they will come back anddo the shredding later.But what if they forget or they do not have time todo it?Or maybe they have no intention of doing it later.In any event, the likely outcome is that the whole shredder bin iscleared by the office cleaner.Thus documents containing personal data orother confidential information will end up being taken away with othergeneral rubbish.Such information is then at risk of being viewed byunauthorised individuals by chance.A final word – a “shred all” policy is safer than going greenSome organisations have committed to going green.In their enthusiasm tosave more trees, they use the reverse side of unwanted papers forphotocopiers and printers.Some of these so-called recycled papers containpersonal data or other confidential information.Of course, there is a high riskof it being viewed by employees who are not authorised to do so.In theworst instances, it may be viewed by individuals outside the organisation.Ineither case, the organisation may fail to comply with the data protection law.When in doubt, it is always good practice to have a “shred all” policy –that is, an organisation should adopt a policy to shred all documents, otherthan materials that are intended for public consumption.Such a policyobviates the need to sieve out documents into a “to shred” pile and a “noneed to shred” pile.It also minimises the risk of making a wrong decision onwhich pile to put the document in.And there are at least a couple of things that an organisation can do tostill maintain a “Go Green” objective.Other than the cheapest models, most printers are capable of printing onboth sides of a sheet of paper.So set the organisation’s printers to print“duplex” or “two-sided” by default or train employees to choose this optionas often as possible.Many office printers are also capable of printing, say, “2-in-1” – that is,the output size is shrunk so that two pages of the document appear side-by-side on a sheet of paper.Combined with duplex printing, four pages areprinted on one sheet of paper.Train staff to choose this option when they areprinting drafts of documents or even some documents that are for internal useonly.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should adopt the following practices in disposing of unwanted paperscontaining personal data:■■■■■Have a “shred all” policy – invest in a good shredder or use a secure document disposalservice.Do not place unshredded papers next to the shredder if the employee is too busy toshred.Do not recycle papers containing personal data or confidential information.Make sure that the bin provided by the shredding service provider has a tightly closed lidand one-way slot to prevent anyone from retrieving papers from the bin.Do due diligence on the service provider to make sure that they have actually shreddedthe unwanted papers.74",,," What can get you into trouble under thedata protection law if the personal data

33,33,Disgruntled employees – insider threats,"From our experience, disgruntled employees tend to do one or more of threethings to “get even” with their employers:■■■Using their insider (or ex-insider) position to harm the organisation byinterfering with its IT systems and data, including both personal data andbusiness confidential dataUsing their insider position to harm the organisation by stealing data,including both personal data and business confidential data, and profitingfrom it themselves or selling it to the organisation’s competitors“Whistleblowing” on the organisation’s deficiencies in compliance withdata protection laws because it’s generally easier, cheaper – sometimesfree of charge – and perhaps more damaging than taking legal actionunder employment lawsHere is why you should pay particular attention to employees who might bedisgruntled and proactively address these insider threats to avoid data orprivacy breaches or complaints that might bring existing data or privacybreaches to light.Reasons why employees are disgruntledSome employees in organisations feel unhappy when they perceive they arebeing treated unfairly or disadvantaged by their bosses or colleagues.Thereare a variety of reasons for such feelings:■■■■■■Bypassed for promotion in job grade or job positionNot recognised or rewarded for contributions to the organisationMaking way for younger and less experienced colleaguesMade scapegoats for the wrongdoings of other colleaguesRetrenched due to downsizing in the organisationMade redundant due to restructuring in the organisation or through mergerand acquisition■ Unreasonable bossesEmployees who are affected by one or more of the above circumstances mayrespond in a variety of ways:■■■■■Stay on in the organisation and tolerate the negativities because they needthe salary to support their families – the “docile stayers”Find ways and means to “get even” with the organisation while remainingemployed – the “malicious stayers”Find ways and means to “get even” with the organisation after they haveleft – the “malicious ex-employees”Resign and leave the organisation (whether happily or grudgingly) tolook for greener pastures elsewhere – the “leavers”Accept the hard fact that they are the unfortunate ones to be retrenched –the “forced-outers”Here are some real-life cases of the damage to organisations relating to data,including personal data, caused by their disgruntled employees and ex-employees 1,2 :■■■Anthony Levandowski was a high-profile engineer at Waymo, asubsidiary of Alphabet (the parent company of Google).He was involvedin the development of self-driving cars.In December 2015, hedownloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo files on his computer, purportedly so thathe could work from home.In January 2016, he left Waymo to join Uber’sself-driving car division, taking Waymo’s proprietary data about itsdevelopment of self-driving cars with him.Waymo sued Uber forinvolvement in Levandowski’s breach of his confidentiality obligation,and, to prevent Uber from infringing Waymo’s intellectual property rights,sought a court order to stop Uber’s self-driving car trials until furthernotice.Tim Lloyd was a programmer at Omega Engineering.He was dismissedfrom his job following strained relationships with his colleagues.Hedecided to take revenge on his former employer and planted a “logicbomb” in the company’s servers.Another employee accidentallytriggered the “bomb”, which caused the company’s designs and softwareprograms to be deleted.Omega lost almost US$10 million in revenue asa result.In a similar case, a software engineer at Fannie Mae installed a scriptinto the bank’s software that when triggered would propagate through thebank’s networks and wipe out all the data in the bank’s databases.■■■Fortunately, the malicious script was discovered and disabled before itcould cause any damage to the bank’s IT systems.An ex-employee of Marriott Hotels, Juan Rodriguez, hacked into thehotel’s reservation system and altered the tariffs for hotel rooms: all3,000 rooms were listed with tariffs of US$12–59, instead of the normaltariffs of US$159–499.As a result, Marriott lost more than US$50,000 inrevenue.Rodriquez was caught when the IP address he used to remotelyaccess the hotel’s system matched the one in his home.Marie Lupe Cooley of Jacksonville, USA, found out from a newspaperadvertisement that her company was looking for someone for a jobposition similar to hers.Her boss’s phone number was on theadvertisement.Cooley assumed that she was going to be fired from thecompany and replaced.She decided to take revenge and erased all thecompany’s blueprints and drawings, worth US$2.5 million.It turned outthat her boss had put up the advertisement on behalf of his wife’s firm.Cooley was fined US$1,000 and fired from her job.Graham Rust worked in a healthcare company for 24 years.He becamedisgruntled when he felt that his bosses were not paying attention to hisefforts.He then decided to set up his own online business by stealingproducts worth £20,000 from his company and selling them on eBay.Hewas caught and sentenced to 8 months’ jail and 200 hours of unpaidcommunity work.What organisations should doOrganisations should pay special attention to the “malicious stayers” and“forced-outers”, as well as the disgruntled “leavers” and “malicious ex-employees”.These groups of people may:■■■sabotage the organisation’s processes and IT systems in ways like thosequoted above in an attempt to disrupt the operations of the organisationand/orsecretly siphon or leak confidential and sensitive information (includingpersonal data) out of the organisation or sell the information tocompetitors and/orwhistleblow and report the organisation’s privacy breaches ormalpractices directly to the data protection authorities, instead ofnotifying the organisation.Organisations should put in place measures to prevent any disgruntledemployee from causing disruption or damage to the organisation’s IT systemsand operations.To catch them in the act might be too late.Here are some good practices which organisations can adopt in additionto considering immediate termination and payment in lieu of notice for“leavers” and “forced-outers”:■ For the “leavers”, the organisation will know their last day of service asthey have delivered their letters of resignation to HR department.Duringthe run-up to the last day of service, the organisation should restrictleavers from accessing highly confidential or sensitive information.On the leavers’ last day, the HR department should collect back their■■security access cards, office keys and cabinet keys.The IT departmentshould terminate their access to emails and IT systems, and disable theiraccess to all biometric-activated systems.For the “forced-outers”, some organisations have a policy of notifyingthem of their retrenchment or other termination of employment on the dayof departure itself and, where necessary, paying them salary in lieu ofnotice.This is to deny them any window of opportunity to causedisruption or damage to the IT systems and operations.The “malicious stayers” are the most difficult to detect as they couldeasily put up a false facade and pretend that everything is going on wellwith them.In the background they could be carrying out nefariousactivities on the IT systems, such as copying or downloading massiveamounts of data, sending the data out of the organisation, or modifying thedata in the databases.The IT department should constantly monitor and analyse the useraccess logs to detect unusual activities such as logging in multiple times,even late at night or during weekends; abnormally high log-ins fromremote locations; or downloading massive amounts of data.This measure should apply to the “leavers” as well, because they■could still carry out the above unauthorised activities during the intervalbetween the submission of their resignation letter and their last day ofservice.The “malicious ex-employees” can also pose a threat to the organisationas they have insider knowledge of the organisation’s systems, processesand operations, especially the weak points.They are even moredangerous if they were employees with privileged access oradministrator rights to the organisation’s IT systems.Organisations should have a blanket policy of restricting all■employees’ access to IT systems and applications to a strict “need toknow” basis.Privileged user access or administrator rights should onlybe granted to a few employees and should be based strictly on their jobroles.These rights should be removed from employees once their jobroles change.Besides scrutinising user access logs, the IT department should alsoimplement data loss prevention (DLP) software that is able to detect andblock sensitive, confidential or proprietary information from beingtransmitted outside the organisation’s security perimeter withoutauthorisation.DLP should be implemented organisation-wide to cover all■■employees, regardless of whether they are staying or leaving andregardless of whether it is thought that they might be, or be becoming,disgruntled.Organisations can also monitor employees’ activities at theirworkplaces, but they must ensure that this is done in compliance withrelevant employment law and data protection law.Subject to employmentlaw requirements, employers must notify employees about the purposesof monitoring and the means of monitoring (for example, via CCTV orthrough their use of emails or IT resources).In addition to the above technical and administrative measures,supervisors should be trained to spot unusual behaviour in the employeesunder their charge, including the “docile stayers”.Supervisors should look for tell-tale signs of employees’ grossunhappiness or dissatisfaction with their work or with people in theorganisation.They should be sensitive in observing how employeesrespond to any of the reasons (as listed at the beginning of this chapter)that would cause them to feel disgruntled.ConclusionIn any organisation, insider threats from disgruntled employees areunavoidable.Do not give them a way to harm your organisation by interferingwith its data assets and/or its IT systems.And with data protection lawsbeing enforced, do not give them another way, a cheap and easy way, ofgetting back at your organisation.Organisations should therefore identify areas where there are bothprivacy and information security risks of disgruntled employees sabotagingor causing disruption to the IT systems and operations.They should put inplace technical and administrative measures to minimise such risks.Importantly, too, organisations should train their supervisors to be sensitiveto employees who show signs of gross unhappiness or dissatisfaction withtheir work or with people in the organisation.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESDisgruntled employees may pose insider threats to organisations.Some good practiceswhich organisations can adopt include:■ For employees who have submitted resignation letters (“leavers”):•••Restrict access to highly confidential or sensitive information.Collect back security access cards, office keys and cabinet keys on the last day ofservice.Terminate access to emails and IT systems, and disable access to biometric-activated systems on the last day of service.■ For employees to be retrenched or otherwise terminated (“forced-outers”):• Notify them on the day of departure itself to prevent serious disruption or damage to ITsystems and operations.■ For all employees (especially the “malicious stayers” and “malicious ex-employees”):•••Constantly monitor and analyse user access logs to detect unusual activities (forexample logging in multiple times at odd hours, abnormally high log-ins from remotelocations, downloading massive amounts of data).Implement data loss prevention (DLP) software to detect and block sensitive,confidential or proprietary information from leaving the organisation.Monitor employees’ activities at their workplaces, but make sure it is lawful and, whererequired by law, that employees are notified.■ For all employees (including the “docile stayers”):•••Have a blanket policy to restrict access to IT systems and applications strictly on a“need to know” basis.Look out for tell-tale signs of unhappiness or dissatisfaction with their work or withpeople in the organisation.Enforce the internal data protection policy and take disciplinary measures againstthose who violate any of the rules.12“How an insider threat operates [true stories]”, https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/insider-threat/.“15 times fired employees got revenge on their companies”,

34,34,Ransomware – pay up or else,"Ransomware: a type of software that is designed to block access toa computer system until a sum of money is paid .—Oxford Advanced Learner’s DictionaryHow does ransomware work?Kidnapping and keeping someone in captivity, and releasing that someoneonly upon payment of a sum of money (“ransom money”) to the kidnapper,has been going on since time immemorial.Today, in the digital world, cybercriminals are employing similar tactics,“kidnapping” and “locking up” data files instead of human victims.Theydevelop a type of malicious software (“malware”) called ransomware thatinfiltrates computer systems and encrypts the victim’s data files.In otherwords, the ransomware converts all the text and data in the computer into lotsof gibberish which the victim can no longer make sense of and thus cannotuse.The perpetrator then sends a message to the victim, demanding thepayment of a sum of money (“ransom money”).Only after the ransom moneyis paid will the perpetrator release a special code to the victim to decrypt theencrypted files – that is, to convert the gibberish back to their originalintelligible form so that the victim can make use of the data again.Sometimes, instead of denying the victim access to his or her own data,the perpetrator threatens to publish the victim’s sensitive information onsocial media or public websites unless the victim pays a sum of money.Theonly way to stop the perpetrator from carrying out the threat is for the victimto pay that ransom money.IT Governance, a leading global provider of IT governance, riskmanagement and compliance solutions, reported in a blog post that therewere roughly 2.8 million known unique samples of ransomware as ofFebruary 2018, and the number is growing.1How does ransomware infiltrate your IT system?How does ransomware get into one’s computer system in the first place?Inthe first reported incident of a large-scale ransomware attack, the one causedby WannaCry in 2017, the ransomware infiltrated the victim’s computersystem by taking advantage of weaknesses in the computer’s operating systemwithout the victim’s knowledge.The ransomware was able to spread rapidlyto other computers connected to the same network through automaticpropagation without any human intervention.Like any malware, ransomware can also enter a victim’s computingdevice (e.g. desktop PC, laptop, tablet, smart phone) when he or she clicks alink on a bogus website, downloads an infected phishing email attachment, orinstalls an infected app.Once it gains a foothold in the victim’s computingdevice, the ransomware encrypts all the data stored in the hard disk of thedevice.■■■Some of the worst ransomware attacks in 2017 were2:The WannaCry ransomware attack infected more than 300,000 computersin over 150 countries.It encrypted the data in the hard drives of infectedcomputers and the perpetrators then demanded payment in Bitcoin todecrypt the data.What was worrisome was that WannaCry exploited avulnerability in the Microsoft Windows operating system using a codewhich had been developed by the US National Security Agency.Fortunately, the WannaCry ransomware was stopped in its tracks beforeit could cause further havoc when Microsoft released software patches tothe affected Windows operating systems.One researcher accidentallydiscovered a “kill switch” (akin to an emergency stop button) thatprevented WannaCry from spreading further to other computer systemsover the networks.The Petya ransomware made use of phishing emails to trick unsuspectingvictims into clicking a file attachment.Once the ransomware penetratedthe victim’s computer system, it tricked the victim into granting itadministrator rights, which is the highest level of privileged access.Theransomware then encrypted the master file table, which serves as a sortof directory for the hard disk.Even though the victim’s data files wereunaffected, the system could not locate where they were, so they were asgood as inaccessible.The NotPetya ransomware resembled Petya in many ways in that it alsoexploited the vulnerabilities in older versions of the Windows operatingsystem.Unlike Petya, however, NotPetya was able to spread to othercomputers on the same network without any human intervention.NotPetyaalso encrypted everything in the computer system, not just the master filetable.It could thus cause irreparable damage to the victim’s computersystem.What is the impact of ransomware?As ransomware renders data files unreadable and prevents normal access toa computer system, business operations that need to make use of the data canbe badly affected.A ransomware attack can cause customers to loseconfidence in the organisation’s ability to securely protect their data.Thismay damage the reputation of the organisation.One real-life impact of WannaCry was that a number of computer systemsin at least 16 health service organisations (hospitals and GP surgeries) underthe National Health Service in the UK became inoperable.Staff were forcedto revert to pen and paper and their own mobile phones after the attackaffected key systems, including telephones.A number of surgical operationshad to be cancelled and patients were advised to seek medical care only inemergencies.3Should you pay the ransom?The key question most victims or would-be victims of ransomware attackstypically ask is: “Should I or should I not pay the ransom money demandedby the perpetrator?”Ransomware perpetrators shrewdly play on the psychology of the humanmind.They make their demands in small amounts of money so that you willbe more willing to part with your money, rather than go through the hassleand embarrassment of reporting it to the police or regulators.Some enterprising perpetrators have even produced and made availableto the victims the “antidote” to decrypt the encrypted data.One such exampleis Locky Decryptor, a software which asks for ransom payments to be madeusing Bitcoin and provides detailed payment instructions (see screenshotsbelow).Once payment is made, the victim receives a decoder to decrypt the data filesthat are being held for ransom.Locky Decryptor even cheekily defines what adata back-up is and provides victims with instructions on how to back uptheir data.Do note that after the ransom money is paid, there is no guarantee that theperpetrator will fully restore all your encrypted data.The perpetrator,sensing that you are an easy victim who gives in readily, may retain some ofyour data in encrypted form so as to extort more money from you.If you have been backing up your data regularly (as explained in the nextsection), you do not need to succumb to the perpetrator’s demands.What are the safeguards against ransomware?What can organisations and individuals do to prevent ransomware attacks?The best safeguard is to back up the data in the hard disk regularly onsecondary storage devices that are not connected to the same networks.Bydelinking these storage devices from the networks, they will not be infectedby the same ransomware that attacks the primary hard disks and operatingsystems via the networks.With the back-ups, most of the data will still berecoverable even if the primary data files are encrypted, and the victims arethus not held hostage by the perpetrators.The shorter the back-up intervals,the higher the likelihood that organisations can restore most of their data.At the holistic level, organisations should review and strengthen their all-round cybersecurity measures to ensure that their valuable information assetsare adequately protected.This involves regularly reviewing andstrengthening the firewalls and intrusion detection systems, installing thelatest software patches to the operating systems, and ensuring that anti-virusand security software are upgraded to the latest versions.Even though someof these measures are playing a catch-up game with the latest evolutions ofransomware, adopting them is still better than the status quo.At the individual level, every computer user has to be constantlyreminded to be vigilant when clicking links on websites, downloading emailattachments and installing apps.Organisations should adopt protocols –standard operating procedures – for individuals clicking on links,downloading documents and installing apps.They should support theseprotocols with regular staff training to enable individuals to be vigilant andavoid letting ransomware (and other malware) into their computing devices.Organisations should ensure that staff are on the lookout for suspiciouswebsites and links, and know how to recognise phishing emails (see Chapter72 for more on phishing attacks).Will ransomware prevail?There is an ongoing “battle” between the perpetrators of ransomware and thedefenders who develop countermeasures to ransomware.The former will getmore sophisticated in exploiting the vulnerabilities in existing computersystems and networks, while the latter will be playing a catch-up game.Theperpetrators will only get bolder once they have tasted success in collectingmore and more ransom money.They may go for more lucrative targets, suchas high-net-worth individuals, huge databases in the cloud, or criticalinformation infrastructures supporting water, power, energy, transportation,banking, healthcare and government sectors.If any of these essential systemswere to be infiltrated by ransomware, the consequences could be disastrous– there could be emergency life-and-death situations that depend on the datain the systems.That is why some governments, such as Singapore’s, havedelinked their internal networks from the external Internet, so thatransomware and other malware are prevented from infiltrating the internalnetworks.Whether ransomware will prevail in this ongoing battle is anyone’sguess.One possible way to demotivate the perpetrators is for organisationsand individuals to implement the necessary preventive measures such that thevictims will not have to pay the ransom money, thus putting the perpetrators“out of business”.This will depend on how quickly, and to what extent,back-up data can be restored.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES■■■■One of the best safeguards against ransomware attacks is to back up your dataregularly on secondary storage devices that are not connected to the same networks.Bydoing so, you will not be at the mercy of the perpetrator and can restore your valuabledata without paying the ransom.Regularly review and strengthen the firewalls and intrusion detection systems, install thelatest software patches, and upgrade anti-virus and security software to the latestversions.Adopt protocols – standard operating procedures – for individuals clicking on links,downloading documents and installing apps.Ensure all staff are trained so that they are vigilant of ransomware threats and phishingattacks.123Source: “Ransomware: What You Need to

35,35,Internet of Things – Internet of Troubles?,"The Internet of Things (IoT), a simple name, yet a powerful concept, hasfired the imagination of numerous people, both developers and potentialusers, since it came on the scene.The ubiquitous Internet has connected 4billion Internet users as of 31 December 20171, enabling people tocommunicate electronically, share information and content, perform all sortsof buy-sell transactions and enable cashless payments.By 2020, IoT willconnect 20–30 billion2 everyday objects embedded with computing andcommunication power, such as smart phones, smart watches, smartrefrigerators, smart TVs and smart cars, just to name a few.In fact, the word“smart” has been so overused that we read about visions of smart buildings,smart transportation systems, smart power grids, smart homes, smarthospitals, smart cities and even smart nations.Smart IoT applicationsOne major manifestation of the “smartness” in “smart things” is their abilityto make decisions autonomously, albeit within a limited scope at this point intime.Here are examples of IoT applications that we can experience today:■■Smart wearable wristbands monitor your body’s vital signs such as heartrate, blood pressure and body temperature, and send you an alert whenany of these cross into the unhealthy zone.Your vital signs can also betransmitted remotely to a doctor who is providing you step-downhealthcare after a major illness or operation, or monitoring a chronicmedical condition.Location-based services on your smart phone help you to locate friendsor places of interest near where you are.Some of these services can evenrecommend restaurants serving your favourite food, shops selling yourfavourite brands or merchandise, or recreation centres with your■■■■favourite sports and games.Such “intelligence” about you is gatheredautomatically based on your online purchases, preferences and searches.The smart lighting system in your home helps you to save energy andreduce your electricity bill by varying the brightness according to theambient light.It automatically switches off the light when it senses thereis no one in the room.It can also brighten up or dim down to create thepreferred mood you want or according to your activity, e.g. reading,having dinner or watching TV.The smart map application on your smart phone plans the journey for youwhen you are driving from Point A to Point B. It communicates with theGPS system on the location of your car at any point in time and computesthe estimated travel time to your destination.Based on your preferences,it can select for you the shortest route, the quickest route, the leastcongested route, or the route that avoids toll roads.The smart traffic light system automatically varies the duration of the redand green lights at traffic junctions depending on the number of vehiclesmoving in the different directions.It can also control the lights to allowemergency vehicles to move through with minimal impediment.Driverless cars are making their debut on a trial basis.They are able tonavigate the roads, vary their speed according to traffic conditions, andknow when to stop or go at traffic lights, all without a human driver.Information security and privacy challenges of IoTWhile IoT offers tremendous potential to make our lives more convenient andmore enriching, it also brings about many information security and privacychallenges.Smart sensors and devices collect and process a lot of data,including personal data, and share it with other devices on the network, oftenwithout our conscious knowledge.■■Some of the major information security and privacy challenges are:Unlike computers and network equipment which have gone through manyevolutions to reach the high standards of information security today, smart“things” have been developed with less consciousness of security andprivacy.Each smart “thing” could potentially be a vulnerable point formalicious hackers to hack into the networks and render the entire systeminoperable or compromise the integrity of the data.Each IoT device connected to the network has a unique identifier toidentify itself to other devices.If such identifiers are linked to some other■■■■identifiers about individuals, e.g. name or mobile number, the personholding the device can be identified.And if the device’s unique identifieris not securely protected, people with ill intent can “steal” the identity ofthe device owner.The volume of data handled by smart “things” is humongous.In someinstances there may not be clarity on who the owner of the data is,especially when location-based data is made available to a number ofcommercial companies.What assurance is there that such data will besecurely protected while in storage devices and while being transmittedover the networks?What assurance is there that such data will be deletedwhen it no longer serves any legitimate purpose?What assurance is therethat the service providers will not sell the data?As a corollary to the above, a lot of personal data is shared by the smart“things” when they communicate with one another.Do consumers have achoice to opt out?Is consent obtained from consumers before theirpersonal data is collected and used?Most of the time, it is impractical toobtain consent from consumers as smart “things” work autonomously.By “eavesdropping” on the data traffic passing between smart “things” onthe networks, someone with ill intent can have access to the sensitiveinformation of individuals or the movements of individuals.For example,a nosy person can learn about the medical condition of individuals; awould-be burglar can know when there is no one at home.Malicious hackers could hack into IoT systems and do great damage.IoTsystems are not confined to information systems, as in the traditionalInternet, but are part of larger physical and operational systems.Forexample, hackers could take over control of the traffic light system ordriverless vehicles, causing havoc or injury to road users.People withmalicious intent could likewise commandeer smart power grids or smartenergy grids, bringing offices, homes and businesses to a standstill.Inlate 2015, a group of hackers took down a power grid in Ukraine, causinga power blackout.3Addressing the challengesSo what can developers, service providers and individuals do to address theinformation security and privacy challenges of IoT?They can adopt thefollowing measures:■■■■■■■■Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to assess anyprivacy risks to the rights of individuals.Implement multi-layers of technical controls, e.g. firewalls, anti-eavesdropping, multi-factor authentication, in order to make it moredifficult for hackers to infiltrate the defences.Install the most up-to-date anti-malware utilities and security patches inoperating systems so as to counteract new threats.Back up important data regularly and secure the storage devices infacilities with strong physical and technical controls.Encrypt the data collected, processed and transmitted by smart “things”.Once the data is encrypted, even if it is leaked or stolen, the recipientcannot make any sense of it.Notify individuals that their personal data will be collected, used andshared by the smart “things”, in lieu of obtaining explicit consent fromthem.Anonymise the personal data such that no individuals can be identified.Even if the data is leaked or stolen, it will not be possible to know whothe data relates to.Establish data retention policies so that data no longer required for anylegitimate business use is deleted or destroyed.From Internet of Troubles to Internet of Trust?The deployment of IoT is still in its infancy.Developers, users and securityand privacy professionals are trying to grapple with the many new challengesand unintended consequences.Will IoT become an Internet of Trust one day,the way the ubiquitous Internet today is trusted by both organisations andconsumers for transactions involving personal and sensitive data?Webelieve that day will come as more trusted technologies and safeguards forIoT devices are developed and embedded in the devices.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIoT has introduced a number of information security and privacy challenges.Developers,service providers and individuals should adopt the following measures:■■Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)Implement multi-layers of technical controls, e.g. firewalls, anti-eavesdropping, multi-factor authentication.■■■■■■Install the most up-to-date anti-malware utilities and security patches in operatingsystems.Back up important data regularly and secure it with strong physical and technicalcontrols.Encrypt the data collected, processed and transmitted by smart “things”.Notify individuals that their personal data will be collected, used and shared by the smart“things”.Anonymise personal data such that no individuals can be identified.Establish data retention policies so that data no longer required for any business use isdeleted or destroyed.123Source: “Internet World Stats”, http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htmA number of industry forecasters and technology companies (including Gartner, InternationalData Corporation, Ericsson and Cisco) have predicted the number of connected IoT devicesto be between 20 and 30 billion by 2020.Source: “How the Internet of Things will affect security and privacy”,http://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-security-privacy-2016-8/?IR=T     99",,," What are examples of smart IoT applications?

36,36,99 PRIVACY BREACHES TO BEWARE OF,"IntroductionTwo good friends walked into a local tour agency to book a cruise holidayfor their respective families.They were puzzled that they had to scan in theirnational identity cards to obtain a queue number.While waiting for theirqueue number to be called, they could hear distinctly a customer serviceofficer (CSO) taking a customer’s booking over the phone and confirming thecustomer’s personal particulars in a very loud voice.They were quite sureeveryone else in the waiting area could hear what the CSO had just said.When their turn came, they walked towards the assigned counter and satopposite the CSO, who greeted them with a standard scripted message.When the two friends asked why their national identity cards wererequired to obtain a queue number, the CSO replied that it was the standardcompany policy for record purposes.They were even more shocked to seepersonal data, credit card slips and cheques of previous customers strewn allover the CSO’s work area.The CSO then asked them which cruise packagesthey were interested in.As they were not quite familiar with what the touragency could offer, they asked the CSO to recommend some of the morepopular ones.“We have a mobile app that gives you great recommendations,” the CSOreplied, and proceeded to help them with the download of the application totheir smartphones.The two friends were both certified privacy professionals and beforedownloading the application they proceeded to read the application’sprivacy policy and permission details.They were horrified to find that theapp requested multiple permissions to access their phone’s device ID,camera, microphone, app history, detailed location, and contacts.This wasinconsistent with the information in the privacy policy, which did not statethe purposes for which the app required all these permissions.The twofriends felt that such access to the personal information in their devices wasexcessive and not proportionate to what was needed by a simple travel guideapplication.“It’s OK,” said the two friends. “We will forgo the app.How about youtell us which are the popular packages from your own experience?”Imagine their horror when the CSO turned her computer terminal aroundand showed them the records of past customers who had booked the mostpopular cruises!The two friends shook their heads and whispered to eachother: “This tour agency has not taken appropriate measures to handle andsafeguard the privacy of their customers’ personal data.We don’t trust ourpersonal data with them.Who else will they share our data with withoutinforming us or getting our consent?Let’s go and look for a more privacy-conscious agency.”Such a scenario is real and has happened.In a number of countries, thelevel of awareness among organisations and individuals with regard to theproper handling and protection of personal data is still low.Even incountries with data protection or privacy laws in existence for many years,we hear in the media of massive data breaches where thousands or evenmillions of individuals’ personal records have been compromised.Wheredata protection or privacy laws are relatively new, the level of awarenessamong organisations is often even more wanting.In either case, not only do these organisations have to face the penaltiesimposed by regulators and lawsuits from affected individuals, they also haveto live with financial and reputational losses.These can be particularlydamaging for organisations that do not have the financial resources or a deeppool of loyal customers to help them weather the storm while they rebuildtrust among their stakeholders.Organisations should therefore recognise thatregardless of their size or the industry sector they are in, they are allvulnerable to privacy breaches if they do not have proper data protectionpractices.Faced with high-profile regulatory actions and multi-million-dollar finesand lawsuits, many organisations around the world today are forced tostrengthen their data protection practices.Similarly, when they consider theadverse implications, particularly in terms of stakeholder trust, of even alimited privacy breach, many organisations choose to strengthen their dataprotection practices simply because it is a sensible way for them to conducttheir business.Governments are reviewing and revamping their data protection laws toaddress new challenges because of emerging technologies and to requireorganisations to treat data protection as one of their critical businessfunctions.For example, the European Union has responded to privacy concernsarising from today’s digital revolution and the need to deal with thecomplexity of data by implementing the General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR), a single unifying data protection law across all its membercountries that came into force on 25 May 2018.In China, the PersonalInformation Security Specification similarly deals with such privacyconcerns and came into effect on 1 May 2018.In the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), all themember governments have committed to legislating and implementing dataprotection laws in their respective countries.This is part of the establishmentof the ASEAN Economic Community, an effort to integrate the region’sdiverse economies into a single market with free movement of goods,services, investments, skilled labour and freer flow of capital.India, after its Supreme Court held in August 2017 that privacy is afundamental right of each of its 1.3 billion citizens, has extensive privacyregulations under development that may become law as soon as late 2018 orearly 2019.In short, virtually every organisation doing business in the EuropeanUnion, China, India or ASEAN will sooner or later have to grapple with newor updated data protection laws.So must boards, senior management andemployees generally.They must either press the reset button with regard tolegal compliance or adopt a new mindset in terms of processing personaldata as part of their everyday operations.We need to move from the “What” to the “How” of data protection.Unfortunately, there are few, if any, books that go into the operational aspectsof data privacy and protection, and uncover the operational risks, threats andvulnerabilities facing organisations.Data protection and privacy must not be a mystery, especially toemployees at the operational forefront of organisations.Operationally, theymust not be something that only lawyers can understand.They must be“owned” by all employees of organisations.About data protection and privacyData protection and privacy have different ideological roots – human rightsand economics – but share many of the same sets of obligations or principles,although they may be expressed in different language or use different terms(see Glossary).We are often asked: “What’s the practical difference between dataprotection and privacy?”In the U.S. the term “privacy” is used in policies, laws and regulationswhile in the EU and many other countries, the term “data protection” oftenidentifies privacy-related laws and regulations.Hence, there is no differenceof definition between a privacy law and a data protection law, or between aprivacy policy and a data protection policy, which we often come across inthe online world.From a privacy professional perspective, they aresynonymous.“Data protection” may be used to mean “information security”.Whenthere is a data breach – when there is a media report, for example, aboutpayment card information being stolen or other customer information beingstolen from a company – that is a failure to protect data.The data might be“personal data” or “personal information” about individuals or it might beconfidential data such as an organisation’s intellectual property or otherbusiness information.Colloquially, a data breach occurs when someone hacks into a computersystem and steals data.This is well known.Newspapers are full of storiesabout hacking.But a data breach also occurs when data is leaked or exposedin some other way.Classic examples include individuals leaving a filebehind on public transport or in a café.Other examples include employeessimply sharing data with their colleagues who do not have a right to see itand individuals speaking loudly in public places and being overheard byothers.As for privacy, it has been described broadly as the right to be left aloneor freedom from interference or intrusion.Data privacy or informationprivacy is the right of individuals to have some control over how theirpersonal data – data that identifies them or relates to them – or personalinformation about them is collected, used and disclosed, as well as how it isstored or disposed of.When it comes to data privacy or data protection laws,the term refers to rules and practices regarding the handling of personalinformation or personal data, such as the concepts of notice, consent, choice,purpose, security, etc.A data breach that involves a theft of personal data or an inadvertentexposure of personal data intrudes into an individual’s privacy.But anintrusion into an individual’s privacy can occur without a data breach, suchas where an organisation insists on collecting excessive personal data fromindividuals or retains their personal data for longer than is justifiable.Hence, in this book, when we use the term “privacy breaches”, we meanmore than data breaches, where there could be non-compliance orcontravention of the data protection law.About information security and privacyAnother question people have often asked is: “What’s the difference betweeninformation security and privacy?”Although the two concepts are different in certain aspects, there is asymbiotic relationship between them.Privacy practitioners have recognisedthat there can be no privacy without security.Information security is concerned with three main elements:confidentiality, integrity and availability, or “CIA” for short.In a nutshell, itmeans that secure measures must be put in place to protect personal data andother confidential information from being stolen, or from being accessed ormodified without proper authorisation.Users of personal data and otherconfidential information must trust its accuracy and currency to make timelydecisions or to handle business transactions.And the right information mustbe available to the right person at the right time.Designing information security systems without privacy in mind couldresult in treating all personal data and other confidential information in thesame manner.But from the privacy perspective, some personal data and otherconfidential information are private, especially sensitive personal data suchas health, financial, ethnic group, religious or political affiliations, ormembership of trade unions.Such sensitive data, in particular, must beaccessible only to people with the appropriate “need to know”.Henceinformation security systems must be designed to allow/restrict access tousers based on their job roles.They must also be designed to have differentlevels of security for different classes of personal data and other confidentialinformation.While information security is about “CIA”, data privacy is about havingrules that govern how personal data is collected, used, disclosed and stored.Data protection laws around the world have obligations or principles towhich organisations are required to adhere.If they don’t, enforcement actionscan be taken, resulting in either a fine or imprisonment.When organisationsfail to comply with these rules, whether they simply flout them or fail toabide by them despite their best efforts, we call this a privacy breach.Therefore, while information security is about governing “unauthorised”access to information (which includes personal data), conversely, it can besaid that data privacy is about governing “authorised” access to informationthat is personal data.However, there can be a privacy breach even when anindividual is authorised to access that personal data.For example, theindividual could have illegally collected the personal data, or could havelegally collected it and later used it for some other unauthorised secondarypurpose, or could have illegally disclosed it to a third-party.In addition,while processing it, the individual may have failed to protect the personaldata, resulting in the data being exposed, leaked, lost or even stolen.To prevent privacy breaches, organisations should put practical measuresin place to ensure information security.The measures should not be anafterthought. “Privacy by Design”, a movement that originated in Canada, isnow gaining wide acceptance and traction around the world and is also arequirement under the GDPR.Privacy professionals are working closelywith information security professionals and IT developers to build privacyelements into IT and information security systems upfront during the designstage.The importance of operational complianceSearch for any obligation under a data protection law or principle under aprivacy law and you’ll be rewarded with an array of results about what thelaw means and what must be done to comply with it – from a legalperspective.But legal compliance alone is not enough.Check theenforcement cases made available by the regulators in Australia, Hong Kong,Ireland, Singapore and the United Kingdom, and you will notice that most ifnot all of these breaches happened because of operational lapses.Search for “data breach” and you’ll be rewarded with an array of resultsabout hackers cleverly infiltrating corporate IT systems and stealing personaldata and other confidential information.Read behind the scenes and moreoften than not the root cause was the action or inaction of an employee or ex-employee, sometimes careless and sometimes malicious.While more oftenthan not the malicious employee or ex-employee succeeds only because ofnegligence in their IT system’s governance, it is also clear that IT systemgovernance alone is not enough.One of our main motivations in writing this book is to fill the gapbetween legal compliance (complying with the obligations and requirementsof data protection laws through organisational policies) and operationalcompliance (embedding privacy practices in the everyday operations andprocesses of the organisation).While legal compliance is obviously necessary, it is not sufficient.Allemployees in an organisation must know at a very practical level – at anoperational level – what to do and what not to do when they handle personaldata and other confidential information on a day-to-day basis.In addition, third-parties such as suppliers, vendors, intermediaries,brokers and agents must know what to do and not do when they handlepersonal data or other confidential information on behalf of an organisation.In short, everyone who has a part in handling personal data or otherconfidential information in the possession or under the control of anorganisation must understand their individual roles, responsibilities andaccountabilities – at a practical level – throughout the information life cycle.Responsibility and accountabilityAs we wrote, we were reminded of the so-called Parable of Responsibility:“Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and Nobody were members of a group.There was an important job to be done and Everybody was asked to do it.Everybody was sure that Somebody would do it.Anybody would have doneit, but Nobody did it.Somebody got angry because it was Everybody’s job.Everybody thought Anybody would do it, but Nobody realised that Anybodywouldn’t do it.It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody, when Nobodydid what Anybody could have done.”1Responsibility can be shared and can be assigned before or after anevent.So, a lawyer can be assigned responsibility for legal compliance withthe data protection/privacy law; an IT specialist can be assignedresponsibility for technical systems compliance.Someone else can even beassigned responsibility for management of physical documents and other non-technical tasks.But none of this responsibility is worth anything unlessindividuals are accountable for their actions or inaction.In fact, when an organisation gets into trouble under the data protectionlaw, including as a result of a complaint by an individual, regulators willinevitably require the organisation to demonstrate accountability forcompliance with it.Simply put, they will be looking for responsibility andownership and they will require evidence of it.Accountability applies only after something is done or not done.If anindividual is accountable for something they are also answerable ultimatelyfor it.There needs to be ownership in order for somebody to be responsible.We have written here about what individuals need to do or not do personallyor what they need to do or not do as employees of an organisation.Organisations, on the other hand, need to document their policies andpractices to guide the actions of their employees.In addition, inevitably theyhave to provide evidence to the regulator, such as training records ordisciplinary actions.Regulators will inevitably require them to demonstratethat they have done everything practically possible to prevent any privacybreaches from happening.For these reasons, in this book we have provided checklists of goodpractices for both individuals and organisations.We intend these checkliststo be a good starting place for operational compliance – both individuals andorganisations should look at them through the lens of the practical situationthey are facing and their own specific circumstances and supplement themappropriately to meet that situation and those circumstances.In short, everyone must be accountable for operational compliance ornothing else matters.Without this, the blame game starts when someone getsinto trouble, and lots of time and productivity is lost.Thrust of this bookThe majority of the chapters in this book are based on our real-lifeexperiences, either in our personal capacities or as consultants and advisersto organisations that collect, use, disclose and store personal data.We notice in our work with clients that everyday privacy breaches, inparticular, happen despite legal compliance and despite good IT systemgovernance.They happen because of a failure in operational compliance.Wenotice the same thing when we read reports about regulatory action aroundthe world – files being left on a bus or in a café, USB drives being lost intaxis and so on.So we set out to write about operational compliance – to highlight thethings that can easily go wrong operationally when an organisation seeks tocomply with data protection/privacy laws.And to write it in a way thatspeaks to our readers, that assumes they are not lawyers or IT geeks – thoughwe certainly welcome lawyers and IT geeks as readers.We think they’ll findvalue too.We have included good practices based on our experiences andobservations.We do not intend to be either prescriptive or all-encompassing.Every situation is different.Organisations should evaluate how our suggestedgood practices should be tailored to their unique circumstances, includingorganisational context and culture.This book is meant for everyone who has an interest in data protectionand privacy, either as an employee of an organisation or as an individual ormember of the general public.Data protection officers, especially, will benefit from the real-lifeanecdotes we cite, including cases of failure to comply with data protectionlaws that result in regulatory action.The subsequent penalties, even wherethe case is settled between the organisation and the regulator, providesalutary lessons.On top of the penalties, organisations incur considerablemanagement time and expense – the diversion of resources from “getting onwith business” – as part of the regulatory investigation, even where acomplaint turns out to be frivolous.Individuals who handle personal data and other confidential informationin their day-to-day operations, such as real estate agents, financial advisers,healthcare workers, salespersons, freelancers or those working in serviceindustries, will find this book useful.Individuals who provide or disclose their personal data to organisationswill become more aware of what they should or should not do in differentcircumstances.Structure of this bookWe have looked at operational compliance with data protection/privacy lawsthrough several broad categories, particularly with reference to theinformation life cycle of collection, usage, disclosure, storage and retention,and disposal or destruction of personal data.The principles under each ofthese stages of the information life cycle are broad and generic enough to beapplicable to most jurisdictions:■Section A: Governance & Information Asset Management.Thesechapters (1 to 7) deal with some broad matters that apply generally todata protection and privacy.■Section B: Collection of Personal Data (chapters 8 to 27).The over-riding principle is that the collection of personal data should be lawful,limited with consent.The principle of consent includes organisationsnotifying individuals at the time of collection of the purposes forcollecting their personal data.It gives individuals the choice ofconsenting to organisations collecting their personal data or withholdingtheir consent – an organisation must not coerce or force consent.Theprinciple also gives individuals the right, having given their consent, tolater withdraw it if they wish to do so.The organisation cannot changethe purposes for which it will use personal data unless it gets freshconsent from the individual.■Section C: Usage of Personal Data (chapters 28 to 39).This sectiondeals with the usage or processing of personal data, which is limited bythe purpose notified to the individual and the consent the individual givessubsequently. (There are some instances where the law allowscollection, use or disclosure of personal data without consent.These arebeyond the scope of this book.)Elements of usage or processing ofpersonal data include a requirement for usage to be fair.■Section D: Data Accuracy & Integrity.Organisations may storepersonal data about individuals, but must ensure its accuracy andintegrity.The rights of an individual to have access to their personal dataand to correct error and omissions, as well as the organisation’sobligation regarding accuracy of personal data, are the subject ofchapters 40 to 48.■Section E: Physical & Environmental Security.All personal data in thecare of organisations should be protected and this includes both securingit physically and ensuring a secure environment.Physical andenvironmental security are covered in chapters 49 to 53.■Section F: Security, Storage, Retention & Disposal of Personal Data.Organisations must protect personal data too and must not retain it forlonger than is necessary for the relevant use.We cover protection ofpersonal data and retention – or, more accurately, the requirement for anorganisation to cease to retain personal data – in chapters 54 to 75.■Section G: Disclosure of Personal Data.Chapters 76 to 88 deal withdisclosure of personal data.Organisations may disclose personal dataonly as permitted in the consent given by individuals after theorganisation has notified them of the purposes for which their personaldata will be disclosed and the individual has consented to thosepurposes.■Section H: New Areas, Developments and Technological Concerns.Finally, chapters 89 to 99 cover new developments and technologyconcerns relevant to the GDPR, as well as new business segments thatmay be prone to potential privacy breaches such as start-ups andindividuals working in the gig economy (or sharing economy).How to use this bookWe expect that some of our readers might read this book from front to back.But more often we expect our readers will want to dip into it and read thechapters of most interest to them at any particular time.We have thus writtenit so that the individual chapters are “freestanding” and without cross-references.We have presented some information more than once to underpinthis approach and hope that those who read it from front to back will forgiveus for a small amount of repetition.1Condensed version of Charles Osgood’s “A Poem About Responsibility”.GlossaryThis book was written in Singapore.We have sought to use terminology thatis not specific to Singapore, however, although our generic language is basedon the data protection legislation in Singapore.Here are some explanationsand equivalents.If your jurisdiction is not listed, words used have anequivalent meaning there.“Data protection law” includes:■■■■■■■■■Personal Data Protection Act 2012 – SingaporePersonal Data Protection Act 2010 – MalaysiaData Privacy Act of 2012 – the PhilippinesPersonal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap.486) – Hong KongPrivacy Act 1988 – AustraliaPrivacy Act 1933 – New ZealandData Protection Act 1998 – United KingdomData Protection Act 1988 – IrelandGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – European Union“Regulator” includes:■■■■■■■■■Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) – SingaporePersonal Data Protection Department (PDPD) – MalaysiaNational Privacy Commission – the PhilippinesOffice of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Hong Kong –Hong KongOffice of the Australian Information Commissioner – AustraliaPrivacy Commissioner – New ZealandUK Information Commissioner’s Office – United KingdomData Protection Commissioner – IrelandThe data protection authority for the country of an organisation’s mainestablishment and, if different, the “concerned authority” where anindividual complainant resides – European Union“Organisation” includes:■■■■■Companies, unincorporated associations, firms and individualsconducting business (as used in Singapore and Australia)Data controller (as used in EU, UK and Ireland)Data user (as used in Hong Kong and Malaysia)Personal information controller (as used in the Philippines)Agency (as used in New Zealand)“Personal data” is synonymous with personal information.“Individual” is synonymous with data subject.“Data intermediary” is synonymous with data processor.SECTION A:Governance & InformationAsset Management“Data is the pollution problem of the information age, and protecting privacy is theenvironmental challenge.”Bruce Schneier 01",,," Who greeted the two friends with a standard scripted message?

37,37,Data protection: don’t forget that it is also,"physical“Data protection” – when you see or hear these two words, what are the firstthoughts that come to your mind?To most of us who are raised in today’sInformation Age and are being bombarded with multimedia-rich informationcontent every day, we will not be too far off the mark when we say “dataprotection” includes:■■■■■Secure databases with multi-layers of access controls, includingpasswords and multi-factor authenticationSecure networks with firewalls and concentric rings of protectionData encryptionData loss/leakage prevention andIntrusion prevention and intrusion detection systemsIronically, even though a lot of data today is in digitised or electronic forms,we still handle a massive amount of paper documents containing personal,confidential, private or sensitive information.The reasons vary.Manyagreements are still in paper form, either for legal reasons or to cater to theparties’ preferences.Official documents, such as land titles, marriagecertificates and educational certificates, need to be in paper form withwatermarks, authorised signatures and seals of the issuing authorities.Otherdocuments, official and unofficial, such as interview or other meeting notesand assessments, are still sometimes more conveniently created and kept inpaper form.The personal data in these paper documents also have to be protected, so“data protection” must include elements that are relevant to paper documentsas well – for example, keeping them under lock and key.The document life cycleFor both business and regulatory compliance reasons, an organisation mustprotect paper documents containing personal, confidential or sensitiveinformation against unauthorised access, use, disclosure, duplication,modification, disposal or loss.To establish effective control measures an organisation needs to firstunderstand the document life cycle – that is, what happens from the point adocument is created or generated to the point it is disposed of or destroyed.This includes understanding how the document is handled at each stage, forwhat reason and by whom.■■The document life cycle:provides the organisation with useful insights on the weaknesses andvulnerabilities in protecting documents in the entire “data protection”chain, and thenenables the organisation to develop and implement appropriatepreventive or mitigating controls to address these areas of weaknessesand vulnerabilities in order to protect the documents.Journeying through the document life cycleHere is a typical approach to determining a document life cycle:■■First, an organisation must compile a list of documents (including forms)that are required to support its various business processes.With thisdocument inventory , the organisation’s objective is to get a clear view ofall of its documents that are to be protected.Second, the organisation must assess each document in terms of itsconfidentiality and sensitivity.This is done so that the appropriate levelof security protection can be assigned to the document.In other words, each document has to be classified according to a■predetermined document classification scheme .Examples of documentclassification include “Confidential”, “Internal Use Only” and “Public”.Third, it is important for an organisation to have clear visibility of whichdepartment or employees within the organisation are responsible forhandling the document at each stage of the life cycle and businessprocess.Therefore, the organisation must construct a document flow diagram .■This traces the movement of the document through its life cycle based onthe organisation’s business processes.Finally, based on the document flow diagram, the organisation mustperform an onsite audit to assess the adequacy of existing documentprotection measures.It must then address identified weaknesses andvulnerabilities to minimise the organisation’s risk exposures.The onsite audit should focus specifically on:■■■Create – where and how the documents are first created or generated,including completing paper formsStore – where and how the documents are stored or archivedUse/Share••where and how the documents are used and shared within theorganisation – high-risk areas include the handing/taking over pointsbetween departments or between employeeshow documents in the possession of individual staff are controlledand safeguarded, including if and how individual staff can duplicateor copy them■Disclose – identifying the “outside” individuals and organisations towhom the organisation discloses documents and how this is done■Dispose – how the organisation disposes of or destroys the documentswhen it has no further use for themBenefits of the document life cycleBy having a systematic process of managing the document life cycle,organisations gain better assurance and confidence that they have addressedand mitigated the risks and vulnerabilities associated with the unauthorisedaccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification and disposal ofpersonal, confidential, private or sensitive information.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIn managing their documents containing personal data and other confidential information,organisations should:■■Understand the purpose and benefits of documenting the document life cycle.Put in place systematic processes to:••••produce a document inventory and to ensure it is kept up to dateimplement an agreed document classification schemeproduce document flow diagrams and ensure they are kept up to date

38,38,Investigated by a regulator? Will it find,"only good… or some bad?When we work with our clients we have a constant refrain covering twothings about data protection and privacy processes:■■concentrate on your operational compliance or you will get into trouble –and concentrate on it continuously with regular audits because it is not a“set and forget” task – andhave an effective complaints resolution process in place to minimise therisk of any complaints to the regulator – audit its effectiveness regularlytoo and learn from complaints received.An adverse outcome of a regulatory investigation – a finding that theorganisation has failed to comply with the data protection law – canobviously have unfavourable consequences, including a fine.But even a“clean” outcome has a downside: investigations are distractions that use uptime and management resources better spent on business operations.Here is one case where an organisation took the time to get everythingright at the outset.And another case where it did not.Case #1: Good processes pay offAn individual complained to the regulator1 that they had received – andincurred charges related to – text messages from a subscription service afterentering their mobile phone number into a website for a chance to win freeflights.The individual complained that they had no knowledge of opting-in toreceive text messages from the organisation.■The regulator established that:when the individual entered their mobile phone number the organisationhad sent them a text message that included a PIN number and the■■individual then entered the PIN number into the website to verify thesubscription andthe website indicated that the service was a subscription service andoutlined the cost and frequency of the subscription element andthe website gave clear instructions on how to unsubscribe from theservice.Therefore the individual had not received unsolicited marketing textmessages as claimed, but had legitimately received subscription service textmessages after opting-in to a service on the organisation’s website.Theregulator was also satisfied that the organisation had put in place appropriateprocedures to ensure that numbers entered on the website were validlyentered.Receiving a text message and actively opting-in removed any doubtabout the validity of the consent.The regulator commented that this case study is a clear reminder thatindividuals need to pay greater attention to information that organisationsmake available to them, particularly on websites.There were no grounds forupholding the individual’s complaint.The organisation might have been complimented on taking the time todevelop and implement a carefully thought-through process that compliedwith the requirements of the data protection law.Case #2: Operational errors have unintended consequencesAn individual provided their payment card details and email address to anorganisation for the purpose of purchasing tickets for a particular concert.More than 12 months later the organisation sent them emails regarding thecancellation of another concert, for which they had not purchased a ticket.The individual was concerned that the organisation had retained theirpersonal data for such a long time and asked the organisation to remove theirpersonal data from its database.At the same time, they complained to theregulator.2 Here is what happened.■Complaint resolved: The organisation informed the regulator that it sent“performer alert emails” to customers who had previously bought tickets.These were only sent in respect of “similar products or services” inwhich it thought previous customers would have an interest.In eachmessage, the organisation gave individuals an easy and free way ofopting-out from receiving future messages.The organisation said that the emails about the cancelled concert had■resulted from an operational error and that it had rectified its internalprocesses so that such an error would not recur.It wrote to thecomplainant to confirm that it had deleted all of their personal data fromits records in accordance with their request.Further consequences: Problem solved and investigation closed, right?Wrong.Regulatory investigations are generally rather thorough.They maywell uncover data protection/privacy issues in addition to the subject ofthe complaint they are investigating.That is exactly what happened to turn an operational email error into amuch wider-ranging investigation and series of actions to be taken by theorganisation.The regulator:••was concerned about the length of time the organisation retainedpersonal data such as payment card details and said it should bereduced from 16 months to 12 months, with the personal data beingdeleted if there was no activity on the individual’s account during thattime andsaid it would be more appropriate for individuals to opt-in to havetheir details retained rather than the existing practice of requiringthem to uncheck a box when they purchased a ticketIn addition, the regulator was concerned that the organisation might nothave appropriate procedures in place for deleting personal data when itwas no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected.Ittherefore obtained a copy of the organisation’s data retention policy.Thisled to the regulator highlighting issues in relation to the privacy policystatement on the organisation’s website.One issue was that the privacy policy statement referred to UK data■protection legislation and made no reference to the Irish data protectionlegislation, whereas the organisation was registered in both England andIreland.The regulator said that a data protection notice relevant toIreland should be published on its website.The organisation said theomission was an oversight on its part and remedied it.Regulator’s overall comments: At the end of the investigation, theregulator said that it was satisfied that the organisation took its dataprotection responsibilities seriously.The regulator was “encouraged” bythe cooperative manner in which the organisation addressed the issuesand implemented the regulator’s recommendations.So, the outcome of the investigation might have been worse.But thatwas doubtless cold comfort to the organisation for a distraction thatcould have been avoided.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES■ Organisations should:••concentrate continuously on operational compliance with data protection laws andregularly audit it, particularly to avoid unintended consequenceshave an effective complaints resolution process■ Individuals should pay attention to information provided to them by organisations, tomake sure that their personal data is not retained beyond a reasonable period and theyhave an option to withdraw consent12See https://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Case-Studies-2008/939.htm, case study 7.See https://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Case-Studies-2008/939.htm, case study 13.03",,," What did an

39,39,Designing privacy into information,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
40,40,systems and processes,"Case AA bank implemented a personalised service for its customers a few yearsago.There was no special announcement or fanfare, and no one was thewiser.I discovered this new service by chance when I inserted my automatedteller machine (ATM) card into the bank’s machine and a welcome messagein big letters greeted me on the display screen: “Welcome <My name infull>”.I felt that this was an invasion of my privacy because even up to thefourth person in the queue could see my name clearly. (How did I know thisdespite my short-sightedness?I could see the name of the person four placesin front of me when I was queueing for my turn.)I reported my discomfort to the bank.The person-in-charge told me thatnames of customers appeared on the screen by default.Customers who didn’twant their names displayed must inform the bank.I suggested to the person-in-charge that, for the sake of privacy, thedefault should have been the other way round: no customers’ names shouldhave been displayed unless they asked the bank to display them.Case BWhenever consumers present their payment cards to merchants or serviceproviders for payment of goods and services, they print a voucher induplicate (sometimes in triplicate) for the cardholder to sign.The voucherserves as a confirmation that the consumer has agreed to the amount charged.Sometimes, the voucher contains the full name of the cardholder, the fullpayment card number and the expiry date of the card.This is a lot of personaldata that is clearly visible to anyone who handles the vouchers.To protect cardholders’ privacy and for security reasons (including toreduce the incidence of fraud), payment card scheme rules require merchantsand service providers to mask details on payment transaction vouchers.Therules seek to achieve a balance between collecting enough informationneeded to process a transaction (and to trace it if there are any cardholderqueries) and respecting cardholder privacy and security.So, for example, the cardholder’s name and the card number aretruncated on the voucher, and the card expiry date is no longer displayed.This is certainly a positive step forward in reducing security risks whileprotecting individuals’ personal data.Case CA number of smartphone apps available for download and installation fromAndroid’s Play Store and Apple iOS’s App Store expect users to grant morepermissions than necessary in order to use the apps.Many of thesepermissions intrude into the user’s privacy, such as allowing the app to lookat or even modify one’s personal data or other confidential informationstored on the device1.We suspect that many of these apps are outsourced by organisations tothird-party software developers to write the codes.Without a clearunderstanding of privacy requirements, these developers could have justsimply picked the permissions from the pre-defined library in Android oriOS by default.Case DThe Westfield Group is an Australian multinational corporation that ownsshopping centres in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and theUnited States.It implemented a ticketless parking system that aimed to makeparking easier and quicker for shoppers2.The system scanned the numberplates of vehicles on entry into and exit from the car parks, and sent an SMSnotification to registered “parkers” recording their entry time and an alertmessage when their free parking time was nearly up.To register for theservice, users were merely required to provide a name, licence plate numberand phone number (with no verification).Privacy experts raised the alarm that any person could register falsedetails and track another person’s physical location via the SMSnotifications.The system’s terms and conditions failed to address any ofthese issues.“Privacy by Design”The above cases illustrate that privacy is best pre-designed into informationsystems and processes, and not included later as an afterthought.Sometimes it may be difficult or too costly to retrofit privacy elementsinto the systems or processes once they are implemented.Software andprocess developers should adopt a paradigm shift to include privacyrequirements in the early stages of design.“Privacy by Design (PbD)”3 was first developed by Dr Ann Cavoukian,the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada, in the 1990s.PbD is an approach to protecting privacy by embedding it into the designspecifications of technologies, business practices and physicalinfrastructures.The first three foundational principles of PbD, which are relevant to thischapter, are:■■■“Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial”“Privacy as the Default Setting” (unlike my experience in Case A)“Privacy Embedded into Design”If PbD makes a lot of sense, then why are software and process developersnot embracing this concept with open arms?Here are some possible reasons:■■■■There is erroneous thinking that security built into systems and processeswill take care of privacy.While there is no privacy without security, security on its own is notsufficient for privacy.Privacy requires, in addition, systems andprocesses to provide individuals with notice, choice and consent.PbD requires a shift in design philosophy which not many software andprocess developers are in the right frame of mind, or adequately trained,to do yet.PbD requires additional time and effort to identify and specify theprivacy requirements upfront.In a highly competitive business environment, software developers,especially, are under pressure to deliver new products and services asquickly as possible in order to be the first-to-market.And yet, a little moretime built into the design at the outset will likely avoid the “pain” of havingto “retrofit” privacy immediately before product launch or, worse, afterreceiving feedback from disgruntled users.New privacy challenges that require Privacy by DesignWith the increasing adoption and usage of security monitoring andsurveillance systems, machine-to-machine communications and the Internet ofThings (IoT), the need for PbD is all the more important.Security monitoring and surveillance systems in the form of high-definition CCTV cameras and drones, for example, are highly intrusive.While security concerns are paramount in today’s world of terrorism, thedesign of security monitoring and surveillance systems should consider theprotection of individuals’ privacy as one of the key elements.An example of a machine-to-machine communication is in the electronicroad-toll system where a vehicle’s passage through certain checkpoints isautomatically captured for toll charging.PbD embedded in the system shouldensure that the system is restricted to computation of toll charges only and themovement of drivers is not tracked.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES■■■Organisations should design privacy into their information systems and processes, andnot add it on as an afterthought.Time and effort must be invested in identifying and specifying privacy requirementsupfront.Privacy must be the default setting and embedded into the design.123See chapter 17, “Organisations, mobile apps and the data protection law”.K&L Gates, Feb 5, 2016, “Privacy concerns over Westfield’s ticketless parking system”, inLexology.Source: Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario website (www.ipc.on.ca) 04",,," When did Case AA bank implement a personalised service for its customers?

41,41,Is document classification really,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
42,42,necessary?,"One of the best practices in information security is for an organisation toclassify documents into different levels of privacy and confidentiality.It canthen accord an appropriate level of security measures to each classification.Typical classifications include “UNCLASSIFIED”, “RESTRICTED”,“CONFIDENTIAL”, and even “STAFF-IN-CONFIDENCE”.Of course, an organisation must ensure that the classification is markedclearly on each document so that employees are alerted to it and know whichsecurity measures to apply.Reasons for not marking documents with their classificationMost organisations do, at least tacitly, divide their documents into those thatthey consider confidential within the organisation (or confidential to, forexample, HR employees) and those that may be shared with the generalpublic.It’s the additional step of marking them with their classification thatraises resistance.This is because a number of our client organisations havenot implemented any classification scheme since the day the organisation wasestablished.To do so now would be an extremely tedious and time-consuming task.We often hear from our clients statements such as thefollowing being used to justify their non-action: “Almost all our documentsare confidential.Instead of stamping the word ‘CONFIDENTIAL’ across allour files and documents, can’t we just assume everything is confidential andinform our employees about it?Besides, classifying our files and documentsinvites more curiosity – people would tend to peek into files marked‘CONFIDENTIAL’ and leave unmarked files alone.”This is hardly the hallmark of a well-run organisation.Or something thatwould engender trust among the organisation’s customers or clients if it wereknown publicly.The consequences of not classifying documentsThe statements made by employees, such as the one above, may soundsensible and sometimes even convincing.But accepting them could lead tothe following situations:■■The tendency to over-classify documentsThis means treating all documents as “CONFIDENTIAL” when some ofthem are obviously not.This is especially confusing when documents thatare meant for public consumption are, as a blanket rule, marked as“CONFIDENTIAL”.And it devalues the integrity of documents thatshould really be classified as “CONFIDENTIAL”.The tendency to assume access to documents is permittedBecause there is no distinct delineation on who can have access to whatinformation, all employees assume they can have access to any documentin the organisation.Best practices adopted by most organisations ensure that highlyconfidential and sensitive information, such as HR and Financedocuments, are restricted to a small group of employees only (based onjob roles or “need to know” basis).Organisations should similarly restrict access to customer, client or■other documents.The dangers of employee turnoverDue to turnover, new employees may not be aware of the organisation’spolicies and practices, particularly if they are not sufficiently briefedabout the way to treat various categories of documents.Classifying documents helps indicate that the organisation does have■an agreed set of principles linked to information classification.Classifications that are self-explanatory are helpful.And the dangers of faulty memoriesOver time, the appropriate level of security measures meant forconfidential documents could be eroded because employees tend toforget what is required.The word “CONFIDENTIAL” on a document is a good visualreminder of the need to treat and handle confidential documents with theright level of security.When driving on public roads, visual cues in theform of traffic signs remind us not to speed, not to overtake, not to do aU-turn, even though we are supposed to know these things.The cost-benefit analysisWhen an organisation adopts document classification, agreeing on theclassifications and the security measures attaching to them is a one-time setof policy decisions.It’s followed by a one-time administrative effort to addthe classification to existing documents.Stamping existing paper documentsso that they include the correct classifications is relatively easy onceorganisation personnel are trained to use the correct classification.Andadding a classification to any other documents they produce in future is rarelyonerous once they get into the habit of doing it.But the benefits of document classification are significant.The risksmentioned above are avoided.Employees are constantly reminded to handleconfidential documents and files with the right level of information security.Employment contracts and handbooks generally require employees tocomply with the organisation’s policies and practices and to maintain theconfidentiality of the organisation’s documents.The organisation usually hasa right to apply disciplinary consequences – a verbal warning, a writtenwarning, or termination for cause – where employees fail to comply withthese requirements.Employees caught mishandling or misusing confidential informationcannot claim ignorance about the status of the documents if theirclassification is clearly marked on them.But if there is no documentclassification scheme and the status of documents isn’t marked on them, theorganisation may not be able to take any action against recalcitrantemployees.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should adopt the following practices when handling confidential documents:■■■■Have a document classification scheme so that the appropriate level of confidentialityand protection can be accorded to each type of document.Clearly mark all documents with their classification status.Do not over-classify documents.Restrict employees’ access to classified documents based on job roles or “need toknow” basis.■ Train new employees on the organisation’s policies and practices in handling classifieddocuments.05",,," What is one of the best practices in information

envelope was correct but the name was wrong.When they opened the envelope they discovered that the bank statement wasnot theirs.It was meant for the customer whose name was on the envelope.Cause: The mistakes were made by a printing company to which thebank outsourced the printing and mailing of its bank statements.It was due toa misalignment by the printing company of the name and address columns ofthe customer list provided by the bank.Incident #22Complaint: Thousands of individuals complained that they could not do e-trade of shares on the company’s online portal as it was down for almost sixhours.Lost opportunity in e-trades for these individuals amounted to a fewmillion dollars.Cause: The computerised system was developed, operated andmaintained by the IT division of the company.The IT division (a cost centre)was subsequently spun off as a separate company.The new IT company, nowoperating as a profit centre, implemented significant cost-cutting measures.There were minimal provisions for contingencies and IT service continuity.Incident #33Complaint: Thousands of customers of an organisation complained that theiruser IDs and passwords had been hijacked to send out spam messageswithout their knowledge.They discovered this only after recipients of thespam messages complained to them.Cause: Someone hacked into the servers of the cloud service providerthat hosted the organisation’s web portal.Almost the entire database of userIDs and passwords of their client organisation was stolen.Incident #44Complaint: Hundreds of members of the public complained to a real estatecompany that they had been contacted on their mobile phones with marketingmessages.They had previously registered their phone numbers with thenational Do-Not-Call (DNC) registry.Cause: An independent agent of the company flouted the DNC policy andrules of the company and contacted the individuals.The organisation carries the responsibility for its vendors and other third-partiesIn the four incidents cited above, what is the common element?In all four,customers and members of the public complained to the organisationsdirectly even though the faults and mistakes were caused by an outsourcedcompany, a spun-off company, a hosting service provider or an independentagent.This goes to show that even though an organisation has delegated oroutsourced its tasks to a third-party, it still has to bear responsibility ifanything goes wrong.In addition to any regulatory penalties arising from a mistake by a vendoror other third-party, the organisation’s reputation and goodwill among itscustomer base and in its community may suffer.Damage to the reputation andgoodwill of an unidentified vendor or other agent will be little or none.Afterall, customers and the public recognise and identify with only theorganisation’s name.Therefore it is important for the organisation to minimise the likelihoodand extent of risks arising from the actions or inaction of its vendors andother third-parties carrying out tasks or operations delegated to them.Theselection of vendors and other third-parties is thus of prime importance.Achieving a shared understanding of responsibilities and obligationsThe first thing an organisation should do before it delegates or outsourcestasks or operations is to draw up a list of responsibilities and obligations ofboth the organisation and the vendor or other third-party.This is to achieve ashared understanding of respective roles and responsibilities – that is, toavoid any misunderstanding or finger-pointing and to minimise the risk ofanything going awry.These responsibilities and obligations should be included in a writtenagreement between the organisation and the vendor or other third-party.Executing the agreement shows that they are agreed and accepted by both theorganisation and the vendor or other third-party.Rather than relying onCourt-determined damages arising from any breach of the agreement, theagreement will typically include a contractual indemnity or specifycompensation due to be paid to the organisation if the vendor or other third-party breaches the agreement.Achieving a shared understanding of operational aspectsThe second thing an organisation should do when it delegates or outsourcestasks or operations is to determine operational aspects of the arrangementthat are relevant in the circumstances.These may include things such as thefollowing:■■■■the service levels that the organisation expects of the vendor or otherthird-partykey performance indicators (KPIs) to be reported by the vendor or otherthird-party to the organisation regularlythe vendor’s or other third-party’s procedures in handling incidents whenthey occur andthe vendor’s or other third-party’s critical operations and contingencyplans to deal with any interruption to them.Initial and continuing due diligenceAs an obvious good practice, before selecting a vendor or other third-party,an organisation should audit their processes and procedures for operationalcapability, including their ability to comply with the data protection law.The organisation may consider some or all of the delegated or outsourcedtasks or operations to be critical to its reputation and success.If so, theorganisation should insist on a feedback process under which the vendor orother third-party warns the organisation of any signs of impending incidentsor faults before they occur.Much as the organisation would like to have close and tight supervisionof how the vendor or other third-party is performing, it may not have theresources to do so.Or there may be practical barriers, such as where thevendor or other third-party is located overseas.In any case, appropriate KPIs are critical.The frequency and detail ofreporting performance against them is also critical.And, it should go withoutsaying, an organisation should review KPI reports carefully and take actionin connection with any actual or threatened shortfalls.All too often, we seecases where reports are simply filed and looming problems are not identifiedby the organisation.The optimal outcomeEventually, mutual trust between an organisation and its vendors and otherthird-parties ensures a long-standing, good working relationship.But it isinvariably built on the bedrock of:■■■a good understanding by an organisation of its vendors’ and other third-parties’ capabilities, strengths and weaknesses through initial duediligence by the organisationa shared understanding of each party’s responsibilities and obligationsthat are recorded by setting them out clearly in the agreement between theparties, andappropriate KPIs that are reported properly and where action is takenearly to remediate any potential problems.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should adopt the following practices when they delegate or outsource theirtasks to third-parties:■■■■Choose a trusted and reliable third-party.Include a list of responsibilities and obligations in the contracts, as well as the indemnityor compensation to be paid if the third-party contravenes any of the terms andconditions.Include expected service levels, incident handling procedures and contingency plans forcritical operations in the contracts.Audit the third-party’s processes and procedures if the tasks or operations are critical tothe reputation and success of the organisation.■■Have a feedback process for the third-party to pre-warn the organisation of anyimpending incident or fault.Have key performance indicators (KPIs) for the third-party to track and report back to theorganisation regularly.1234There were several enforcement cases involving statements sent to the wrong recipient.Breach of the Protection Obligation by NTUC Income (3 May 2018) and Toh Shih

45,45,We don’t get any complaints so that’s,"good, right?Well, maybe not.A data protection law generally gives a regulator powers:■■to send auditors or investigators out to visit organisations and check ontheir compliance with the law andto receive complaints from individuals about a possible failure to complywith the law and then to investigate itWhere the regulator elects to do only the latter, the regime is said to be a“complaints-based regime”.In fact, it is a “complaints-based enforcementmodel” for so long as the regulator elects not to adopt the more proactive –and resource-intensive – audit model.It is very easy to think that no complaints to an organisation means that itsclients do not have anything that they feel like complaining about to it andtherefore there is little or no risk of a complaint about data protection to theregulator.But maybe “no complaints received” or, more accurately, “nocomplaints recorded as having been received” could mean the organisationdoesn’t have a complaints process that is working well.For example,individuals might be complaining to frontline employees and they are dealingwith them.Maybe well; maybe not – sometimes even simply brushing themaside.Where the complaints are about data protection, that is a sure-firerecipe for the complaints to be escalated to the regulator.The only questionis when this will happen.As I read data protection case reports I often find myself thinking: “Thisis so petty.Didn’t this individual have something better to do with their timethan file a complaint with the regulator?”Reading further it becomes evidentthat the individual started with a problem or request, often quite a smallproblem or request, that may not even have concerned data protection.Butthey simply could not get any meaningful response from the organisation.Finally, in desperation and finding some kind of connection with dataprotection, they turned to the regulator to get some attention, to find someonewho would listen to them.Why go the extra mile with a complaints process?It may sound counter-intuitive, but a well-designed complaints process givesan organisation valuable input for improving:■■the way it collects, uses or discloses personal data about its clients andthe way it communicates with its clients.And in at least some jurisdictions an organisation fails to comply with thedata protection law unless it has a complaints process.Elements of a well-designed complaints processHere are some tips on designing an effective complaints process inconnection with the collection, use or disclosure of personal data.■Make it easy for individuals to complainLet individuals know how to complain to the organisation.For example,include on the organisation’s website a phone number or an email and/orpostal address and the job title of the employee who will help themresolve their complaint – the data protection officer (or their delegate) inthose jurisdictions that require an organisation to have a data protectionofficer.Include this information in or with the organisation’s privacy notice.Consider too the feasibility of letting individuals know what informationthe organisation will need so it can resolve their complaint.■Make sure employees know who handles complaintsLetting individuals know how to complain will not always work.Someof them will call the organisation’s switchboard number, write to its headoffice address, send an email to an “enquiries@…” address or submit anonline enquiry through “Contact Us” on its website.Or simply complainto the employee with whom they are interacting about the organisation’sgoods or services.Make sure that responsibility for regularly checking any“enquiries@…” or similar email address and any online enquiry formsregularly – at least daily – is assigned and do periodic complianceaudits.Make sure that employees checking these sources, answering thephone, opening the mail and dealing face-to-face with customers knowwho is responsible for handling complaints.And that they know to passcomplaints on to this employee without delay.It sounds obvious, right?We are amazed how often this simple step isoverlooked or forgotten, including as a result of employee turnover.■Acknowledge the complaint as soon as it is receivedIt is good practice to:•••acknowledge a complaint in writing as soon as the organisationreceives itask for any information that will obviously be needed in order toinvestigate the complaint andprovide information about when the organisation will respond to thecomplaint.Why?To reassure the complainant that the organisation has received theircomplaint and is taking it seriously; to manage their expectations aboutwhen they will receive a response; and to forestall them complaining tothe regulator.Then be sure to investigate and respond to the complaint as soon asreasonably possible and, of course, within any time period specified inthe data protection law.■Internal complaints investigation processThere is no “one size fits all” when it comes to devising andimplementing a complaints investigation process – it depends on the sizeand complexity of the organisation and the points at which it collects,uses or discloses personal data.For example, whether an organisationoperates from several different locations or from a single location andwhether it has a wide range of different categories of individuals thatprovide it with their personal data.The first common factor in all well-designed complaints investigationprocesses is that responsibility is clearly assigned:••to specific employees (usually by job title)to carry out specific tasks in the process.Each employee must clearly understand what is expected of them.This isparticularly important where the data protection law does not require anorganisation to appoint a data protection officer to take responsibility forthe organisation complying with it.The second common factor is that evidence must be collected andretained by the organisation of each step taken in the complaintsinvestigation process.In addition, at least where they are not obvious, thereasons for making decisions one way or another must be documented forfuture reference.In any regulatory investigation, the regulator willrequire evidence, preferably documentary evidence, about what theorganisation has or has not done and the reasons why.The third common factor is that the data protection officer – or, wherethere is no requirement for a data protection officer, the employee withresponsibility for handling data protection complaints – must havesufficient authority within the organisation, or have sufficient seniormanagement backing, to be able to ensure that each employee involved inthe investigation process plays their role efficiently, effectively and withintegrity.■Escalation of complaints internallyIn some instances, it may be rather obvious (or at least likely) where acomplaint is not resolved in favour of the complainant that “theorganisation has not heard the last about this”.Or that the complaint andresponse might, for example, “go viral” on social media.The data protection officer or other employee responsible forhandling complaints should be attuned to recognising these cases.Theyshould do at least two things before providing the complainant withnotice of the outcome of their complaint:••notify senior management about the complaint, the outcome ofinvestigating it and the risk of bad publicity so that there are “nosurprises” andensure that a public relations response by the organisation isprepared, at least on a “just in case” basis.■Informing the complainant of the outcome of their complaintIt goes without saying that the organisation must inform the individualabout the outcome of their complaint.Typically, if the complaint is resolved in favour of the complainantthere is no need to provide them with any written confirmation of thatoutcome unless they request it.••Otherwise, the organisation should:provide the complainant with written notice of the outcome, includingthe organisation’s reasons for that outcome andinform them of any third-party sources they can contact if they are notsatisfied with the outcome, including the regulator.■Internal analysis and reportingThe data protection officer or other employee who is responsible forhandling complaints should provide a written report periodically tosenior management about complaints received since the last such reportand any actions taken or planned to address their underlying causes.They should first analyse the complaints received and their outcomesto see if there is any pattern indicating action that the organisation shouldtake to reduce the number of complaints.For example, if there is a sudden increase in the number of complaintsabout the way a particular division or department of the organisation usespersonal data, the underlying cause should be investigated.It mayindicate that remedial training needs to be given to employees or thatthere is some other operational problem.If there is an increase in the number of complaints and the increaseties back to a new form or process introduced by the organisation to, say,collect personal data and most of the complaints are resolved in favourof the organisation it may mean that communication with customersshould be improved.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations with a proper and well-designed complaints process should:■■■■■■make it easy for individuals to complainmake sure that employees who may receive complaints know who handles themacknowledge the complaint in writing as soon as it is received by the employee who willhandle itensure that they have designed and implemented a complaints investigation processwhere each involved employee knows their role in ithave an escalation process to notify senior management of complaints that may attractadverse publicityinform the complainant of the outcome of their complaint and■ have an internal analysis and reporting regime so that complaints are brought to theattention of senior management and remedial action may be taken to reduce them.07",,," What does a data protection law generally give a regulator powers?

46,46,What if your warehouse loses personal,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
47,47,data belonging to your organisation?,"Does your organisation outsource storage of archived files to a storagewarehouse vendor?What if you discover that the vendor has lost cartonsbelonging to your organisation?That happened to an organisation we heardabout.Let’s call it Company A.Apparently, Company A’s vendor – let’s call it Vendor X – decided toclose down.Vendor X told Company A that it was not renewing the lease forCompany A’s document storage.When Company A withdrew all its cartonsfrom Vendor X to place them with a newly appointed vendor, Vendor Xinformed Company A that a number of cartons had been lost.The cartonscontained all kinds of personal data – invoices, credit card transaction slips,insurance reports, and bank slips.What would you do if faced with this apparent breach of the dataprotection law – this apparent failure to protect the personal data in the lostcartons and a possible unauthorised disclosure of it as a consequence of theloss?Contract terms fiascoTo aggravate matters, Company A’s lease agreement with Vendor X wasunfavourable to Company A. Under a “limitation of liability” clauseCompany A had agreed that it would not hold Vendor X liable for any loss ordamage exceeding $10 per carton.In addition, it would not hold Vendor Xliable for any consequential loss or damage.We were surprised thatCompany A had agreed to these terms.With the limitation of liability, it was no wonder that Vendor X informedCompany A rather nonchalantly that the cartons were lost and offered to pay$10 per carton as compensation.Meanwhile Company A had a serious incident on its hands – a failure toprotect personal data under its control.Company A was accountable to boththe data protection regulator and its customers.To make matters worse,Company A had not made an inventory of the contents of each carton andtherefore did not have any idea which customers’ data were lost.To notify or not?In some jurisdictions1, there is a breach notification requirement – that is, itis compulsory for an organisation to notify the data protection regulator in theevent of a data breach.In others2 there is no such requirement, but theregulator typically encourages organisations to notify them in such an event –that is, there is a voluntary notification approach.It is seen as a goodpractice.A voluntary notification approach applied to Company A. The basicprinciple is to prevent further harm.When Company A asked us whether it should report the incident to theregulator, our recommendation was “not yet”.This was because Company Ahad not yet done a full investigation as it didn’t have all the facts.What ifCompany A informed the regulator that there had been a data breach and thenthe cartons showed up later?It would be embarrassing.We asked Company A to conduct a full investigation.We suggested itgive Vendor X two weeks to investigate and confirm if the cartons were:■■■■completely lost (that is, stolen) ormisplaced orgiven to the wrong customer of Vendor X ormistakenly trashed.With that information, Company A could decide whether the incident wouldbe reported to both the police and the data protection regulator.As it turnedout, Vendor X confirmed that the cartons were probably misplaced,prompting Company A to report the loss of personal data to the regulator.Vendor selection and monitoringThis incident demonstrates the need for due diligence and care when anorganisation outsources the management or storage of documents containingpersonal data.Storage warehouses may be particularly risky if not managedwell, including documents being forgotten as the years go by.Here are some tips to apply to any outsourcing contract:■■■Vet the vendor carefully prior to selection to ensure they practise propermanagement controls and practices, including data protection controlsand practices.Continue to monitor and audit their controls and practicesthrough the life of the contract.Ensure contract language is written to cover data protection and privacyfrom the perspective of both regulatory requirements and theconfidentiality expectations of customers.Conduct a risk assessment on each shortlisted vendor.Conduct a more in-depth assessment of the likely successful vendor.A risk assessmentshould include consideration of the vendor’s privacy and informationsecurity policies.It should also include the vendor’s controls over accessto personal data.In other words, an organisation should make sure that itknows and assesses where the personal information will be held alongwith who may have access to it.Vendor contractsAn organisation needs to ensure that every vendor contract is tailored to thefacts and circumstances of the service to be provided by the vendor to theorganisation.An organisation should never sign a standard form contract presented bya vendor without reading it, understanding its terms and the risks to theorganisation resulting from them, and either negotiating any necessaryamendments or consciously accepting the risk of not doing so.The contract should usually include at least the following requirements toprotect the organisation in connection with personal data under theorganisation’s control:■■■■■■■The type of personal data the vendor will have access to at remotelocationsHow the vendor must or must not use and/or disclose the personal dataHow the vendor will protect the personal dataThe vendor’s responsibilities in case of a data breachHow the data will be disposed of when the contract is terminated or, ifearlier, as and when the vendor no longer needs to retain the personaldata to perform its services under the contractThe organisation’s rights of audit and investigationAs between the organisation and the vendor, each party’s liability fordata breachCHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should have the following practices in place when outsourcing the storage ofpaper documents containing personal data or other confidential information:■■■■Do the necessary due diligence and risk assessment of the vendor before outsourcing.Ensure proper contracts are in place, especially covering the vendor’s responsibilities toprotect the personal data.Audit or regularly monitor whether or not all paper documents that contain personal dataare properly secured.If you discover a data breach in connection with your outsourced document storage andassess the risk of misuse of data as low, conduct thorough investigations beforedeciding whether or not to notify the relevant authorities.12For example, Germany, Australia, Philippines, Korea, Taiwan and Mexico as well as theUnited States (where a majority of the states have breach notification laws).The GeneralData Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union also requires notification to theregulator within 72 hours.Including Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.SECTION B:",,," What did Vendor X inform Company A that it was not renewing the lease for document storage?

48,48,Are your sales and service counters,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
49,49,compliant with the data protection law?,"I recently shopped at an electronics store and had cause for complaint underthe data protection law.When I was about to make the purchase, thesalesperson on duty asked:“Can I have your full name, contact number, address and identity cardnumber, please?”Why would a store ever need my identity card number when all I’m doingis buying a product?I replied:“Excuse me, why would you need my identity card number?”“Sorry,” came his reply. “We don’t need it.Just the other information willdo.”He gave me a scrap of paper to write the information down.I did so.Iwas curious to see how he would be using it.That was when I noticed thatall the other sales assistants on duty were doing the same thing: they wouldall use the paper as a reference when keying customer details into their POS(Point of Sale) system.This was presumably to ensure that the inputs wereaccurate.Watch out when you collect personal data on scraps of paperAfter the sales assistant keyed my details into the POS system he handed memy product and thanked me for patronising the store.While I was happy withthe purchase and the price I paid for it, I had a big issue with him and thestore.He left my personal data beside the POS input device.He hadforgotten about it.Anyone could see it.Not just the next salesperson, whichwould be bad enough, but the next customer too.I said to him, “Excuse me, can you please get rid of my personal data?”He looked at me, and hesitated.Obviously he was not trained ininformation security.At first, he wanted to crush the piece of paper andthrow it away.Then he paused and tore it up instead.Do not expose personal information of customers on your POS systemBecause of this little incident, I started looking around the store.I noticed that there was another piece of paper with a customer’spersonal data beside a computer nearby.And that the computer monitor wasdisplaying the order page of another customer.The sales assistant wasserving a woman a few metres away, oblivious that I was inspecting hisentries.I could see her full name, contact details, address and all theproducts she had bought.In fact, the computer terminal was in full view ofthe public.Anyone could go up to the computer and peek at customers’personal data.Do not pile invoices or receipts where they are within reach of the publicAs I made payment at the cashier counter, I found another disturbing sight.Behind the payment counters were piles of invoices and receipts ofcustomers left out in the open.There were also files containing purchaseorders, return receipts and other confidential information and personal data.The area was not restricted.Anyone could pick them up without beingnoticed and walk away.I felt uncomfortable seeing my information “dumped” into a tray after Ipaid for my purchase.I wondered if senior management of the organisationknew that the data protection law is in force.If so, there was no evidence thatits sales assistants had been trained in how to comply with it operationally.Iwondered if they knew that the organisation could get into trouble ifsomebody complained about their personal data being disclosed topassersby.Achieve operational compliance with the data protection law, not justlegal complianceThe protection obligation or principle under the data protection law requiresorganisations to make reasonable security arrangements to protect thepersonal data that they possess or control.This is to prevent unauthorisedaccess, collection, use, disclosure or similar risks.In the case of my retail experience, the organisation’s policies andpractices were likely not compliant with this obligation or principle.Personal data was not protected.There was leakage or exposure to thepublic.If your organisation has retail or service counters, is it compliantwith this obligation or principle?Often when I ask organisations if they are compliant with the dataprotection law the answer I get is that their lawyers have done the duediligence by reviewing their documents and that training has been conductedfor their staff.However, these measures will merely get you legal compliance.Butoperational compliance doesn’t necessarily follow.Operational compliancecan only be achieved if you have implemented information security policiesand practices, and embed them into the operational processes.Training your staff about “what” the data protection law is about isdifferent from training them “how” to comply with it.That includes enforcingyour information security policies.You should do an onsite data protection readiness audit of your entireoperations.You should ensure that your information security policy isamended accordingly.You should ensure that your organisation’s informationsecurity vulnerabilities are tackled.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIn complying with the data protection law, organisations should do the following:■■■■■■Ensure it achieves operational compliance with the data protection law, in addition tolegal compliance with it.Avoid using scraps of paper to record personal data so as to prevent unnecessaryleakage or exposure of personal data.Do not expose personal data of customers on your POS or computer systems.Do not place invoices or receipts of customers in open places that are within reach ofthe public.Conduct periodic onsite data protection audits to monitor continuing operationalcompliance.Identify any deficiencies or gaps and change processes and procedures toimprove operational compliance.Train your employees on the data

51,51,organisations,"The newspapers frequently report newly discovered data breaches that soundlike an organisation is the victim of a dastardly crime perpetrated bymysterious hackers.Sometimes the reports note that these data breaches arebeing investigated by the regulator and sometimes they tell us that theregulator plans to take action against the organisation.We do not often hearsubsequently that the incident would not have happened except for the actionsor inaction of employees – that it was not so much a dastardly crimeperpetrated by mysterious hackers, but a case that is more attributable tocareless or malicious employees within the organisation.But, nevertheless,“cyber-security” is getting a lot of attention, and causing a lot of alarm, at alllevels of business and government.In any event, while these cyber-related incidents get media attention, theyare not the only incidents organisations should be guarding against.Paperdocuments may be the Achilles heel for many organisations – the weakness inspite of overall strength that can actually or potentially lead to data breaches.Just as electronic databases may be compromised, paper documents can alsoget organisations into trouble due to the actions or inaction of carelessemployees within the organisation.Let’s check out some statistics to understand what’s going onThe Ponemon Institute asked 584 IT professional how data breaches occur.Inthe study titled “Aftermath of a Data Breach”, published in January 2012,66% of respondents cited employees and other insiders as posing the greatestthreat to an organisation’s sensitive data.Specific to the loss of paper records, one study of 1,500 data breaches in2013 and 2014 found that it was one of two most common sources ofbreaches, accounting for 24% of total breaches1.A data breach may have severely adverse business implications.Aregulator may also determine that it constitutes a failure to comply with thedata protection law, namely the obligation or principle that requires anorganisation to protect the personal data in its possession or under itscontrol.In the year before writing, we did more than 50 onsite data protectionaudits of organisations in Singapore and Malaysia.Most of these auditclients were small or medium enterprises (SMEs).The biggest risks weidentified related to paper documents containing personal data.The top fiveareas we identified (outside the IT infrastructure) in organisations weaudited were:■ 73% had confidential information/personal data lying exposed on desksto which other employees had easy access – that is, the desks were not in■■■enclosed offices68% had uncollected printed documents and/or original documents lefton, at or around the photocopier50% had unlocked or exposed screens on computers/mobile devicesand/or unlocked cabinets or locked cabinets with the keys left in thekeyholes33% had papers and/or documents with confidential data thrown intowastepaper baskets or recycle binsAs you can see, the risk of paper documents tends to be overlooked at analarmingly high rate.These findings were made within organisations thatwere conscious enough about data protection to have asked us to audit themfor operational compliance with the data protection law or who had sentemployees to our hands-on data protection officer’s course.We can onlyguess that results at other organisations would be even more alarming.Tips for finding and fixing data protection risks in paper documentsThe gaps in operational data protection compliance we mentioned above areeasily addressed with recommended information security measures that arerather obvious.Our audit methodology included a data inventory assessment and ananalysis of the flow of personal data within the organisation.This wasfollowed by an actual site inspection of where personal data was collected,processed and stored.The risks mentioned above were identified simply byobservation.So, what’s our tip?An organisation should do regular onsite audits toidentify its operational data protection compliance risks.An audit can bedone by suitably trained employees or by suitably qualified and experiencedexternal consultants.For many organisations, paper document-related risksare a time-bomb waiting to explode!CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and individuals handling paper documents containing personal data or otherconfidential information should do the following:■ Understand that while IT-related risks of data breaches might be significant, paperdocument-related risks should not be overlooked.■■■Conduct an onsite audit of your organisation’s operational compliance with the dataprotection law, or hire a suitably qualified and experienced external consultant to do aninitial identification of the paper document-related data protection risks.Respond to risks identified in the onsite audit by adopting policies and documentedpractices to eliminate or minimise the risk.Organisations should ensure that allemployees are trained and will implement those policies and practices properly.Develop a schedule for further periodic onsite audits to ensure compliance with existingpolicies and practices and identify any additional gaps that should be closed.1https://www.beazley.com/news/news/bbr_1500_breaches.html 34",,," What do the newspapers often report?

52,52,Photo and video images – including CCTV,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
53,53,– can be personal data too,"It’s rather intuitive that the data protection law covers personal data about anindividual that is in a written hardcopy document or in an electronicdocument or file – less so that the image of an identifiable individual in aphoto or video is their personal data and also covered by the data protectionlaw.That was alarming enough in a world of film, where the expense ofbuying the film and, after it was used, getting it developed and printed wasrelatively high.Now almost every mobile phone comes with a built-incamera that can take both still shots and videos.So now photos and videosare, effectively, free of charge except in those relatively rare instances wherethey are printed.Huge numbers of them are taken daily; thousands of videosare uploaded to YouTube every day; millions of individuals swap photosevery day.Personal photosThe good news is that data protection laws do not extend to what individualsdo for personal or domestic purposes.1If my friend takes a photo of me at their child’s birthday party, forexample, the data protection law does not require them to get my consent tocollecting my personal data – that is taking the photo – or to using ordisclosing it to their friends and family by showing them the photos from thebirthday party.If they want to post it on social media then, out of politeness,they might ask me if I mind, but the data protection law doesn’t require themto get my consent.On the other hand, if my friend wants to use the photo of me from thebirthday party in a promotional brochure for their business, they would fail tocomply with the data protection law if they did not first obtain my consent.This is because they would be using it for a business purpose.Identifiable individuals onlyFurther goods news.The data protection law does not apply to an image ifindividuals are not identifiable.My friend showed me a couple of photos taken with her smartphone at theBotanic Gardens of a group of people including a TV celebrity.The firstphoto was taken from a distance and it was impossible to identify anyone init – there was simply not enough definition.So, no personal data.Theoutcome would have been the same if they had been facing away from thecamera and unidentifiable without seeing their faces.Or if the image hadbeen blurred or taken in inadequate lighting.The second photo was taken from only a few feet away from theindividual.Their face was clear.Not being a TV fan, I had no idea of theirname in real life or of their TV persona either so that I could find out theirname.But not knowing their name makes no difference.Because they wereidentifiable, the image in the photo was their personal data.Photos and videos in a public place – publicly available informationAn organisation may collect, use or disclose publicly available information2without the consent of the relevant individual.So, for example, it may takephotos or make videos in a public place such as a public park or garden, inthe street and inside a place that is open to the general public (such as amuseum, shopping centre or theme park).Be careful, though.Some places might be public most, but not all, of thetime.For example, a restaurant is usually a public place, but if anorganisation books it out for a customer event – that is, it is closed to generalentry – it is not a public place for the duration of that event.The organisationwill likely fail to comply with the data protection law if it does not obtainconsent for the collection, use or disclosure of the images of event attendees.And some places have both public areas and private areas.For example,a grandstand at a sporting arena may have private “boxes” in addition to itsgeneral spectator area.Images of individuals enjoying a party in a privatebox are not publicly available information, even though they are separatedfrom the public space only by a glass wall or there is a clear view throughwindows.Here’s a good test: if any stranger might wander into view at any time,the place is probably a public place.Nevertheless, it is good practice for an organisation to put up signsnotifying individuals if the organisation is taking photos or making a video ina public place.This is so that individuals can avoid being in the photos orvideo if they prefer.3Getting upfront express consent for photos or videos is not a good ideaSome organisations use photos or videos extensively as promotional tools,posting them to Facebook, for example, or including them in their regularnewsletters to publicise their events.A common mistake they make, usuallythinking they are being administratively efficient, is to get express consentfrom individuals at the outset of the organisation’s relationship with them.For example, we see voluntary welfare organisations, sporting clubs andother associations including a consent for collection, use and disclosure ofphotos and videos in their intake, membership or other similar documents.Sometimes it is optional; sometimes it is a condition of obtaining the serviceor joining the club or association.Here is the trouble with doing this:■■If consent is a condition of obtaining the service or joining the club orassociation, a regulator may consider that it is a “coerced” or “forced”consent because it is not reasonably necessary for that purpose.If so, theconsent is not valid.In any event, the individual has the right under the data protection law towithdraw their consent at any time.Therefore, obtaining consent upfront achieves little or nothing in terms ofadministrative efficiency.It means that the organisation must keep track ofwho has consented and not withdrawn their consent.And it must do so for allindividuals, sometimes over a long period of time (versus addressing consentissues only when it considers using a photo or video that includes the imageof an individual).Photos and videos in non-public placesHere are some tips for organisations in connection with photos and videos innon-public places.■■When the organisation invites individuals to an event it should notifyinvitees that photos and videos may be taken and specify the purposes forwhich they may be used/disclosed.Similarly, if the organisation has anonline registration portal it could include such a notice on the portal.At the registration counter or other entry point to the event, theorganisation can put up a similar prominent notice.Organisations should usually do both of these things to reduce the risk of anindividual saying that they were not aware that their image might be captured.After all, some individuals may attend an event (with a friend, for example)without seeing any invitation or registration and some individuals may not beattentive when they arrive at the event.If the individual is aware that photos may be taken or videos made andthey nevertheless attend, the organisation should ordinarily be able to rely ontheir attendance constituting consent to the organisation collecting, using ordisclosing their image for the stated purpose.■■The individual can withdraw their consent at any time before their imagebecomes publicly available information as a result of it beingused/disclosed by an organisation.Therefore, an organisation needs tokeep good records of any withdrawals of consent.Some organisations prefer to obtain express consent for use/disclosure ofa photo or video even where they may rely on implied consent.If the individual is known to them and readily contactable, obtainingexpress consent may be administratively more convenient than keepingtrack of whether or not the individual has withdrawn their consent.If the individual may have some sensitivity about their image beingused by the organisation, obtaining express consent may simply be abetter way of maintaining a relationship with them (versus annoying themby using their image, perhaps in some way that they dislike personally).My photo was taken recently without my knowledge in the foyer of ahotel – obviously a public place – chatting with a colleague beforeentering the nearby ballroom for a gala dinner.Throughout the eveningthat photo and photos of other individuals taken in the foyer and at someseminar sessions held earlier that same day were shown on a loop onseveral large screens on the walls of the ballroom.I was really unhappyabout it and annoyed with the organisation, even though I had no validreason for complaining.CCTVIf an organisation has a CCTV system at its premises it may capture imagesof visitors.Most if not all organisations choose to rely on individualsimplicitly consenting to the collection, use or disclosure of their personaldata by the CCTV system.That’s why organisations need to put up a notice about the presence ofCCTV cameras and, if not obvious, their purpose in a place where they areseen by individuals before they enter into the field of any cameras.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should adopt the following practices before capturing photos or videos ofindividuals, then using or disclosing them:■■■Notify individuals you will be taking photos or making videos before relying on implicitconsent, including in connection with CCTV.Put up warning signs in public places that you will be taking photos or making videos.Reconsider the photo and/or video consent upfront for administrative efficiency in light ofthe data protection law.An individual who takes a photo or makes a video for a personal purpose should getconsent before using/disclosing it for a commercial purpose.123This is expressed differently in various data protection laws – for example, “personal ordomestic”.This is a general principle.There are variations under the data protection law in differentjurisdictions.In any event, organisations should avoid using the images of strangers for commercialpurposes without their consent because, in some circumstances, an individual may be ableto claim compensation for commercial exploitation of their image.Or there may be otherunintended consequences.11",,," What law covers personal data about an individual?

55,55,reservations – risks for restaurants,"I was passing by a restaurant the other day.Its registration stand was justoutside the entrance.There was a reservation list.The woman in charge wasnot around.I could see the names and mobile phone numbers of individualswho had made reservations to dine at the restaurant.The restaurant is obviously oblivious to the data protection law requiringprotection of personal data – including no unauthorised access to it and noaccidental disclosure of it.It’s likely that it’s oblivious to other requirementsof the data protection law too.Failing to protect personal dataThe data protection law requires an organisation to reasonably protectpersonal data in its possession and to prevent unauthorised access to it.So what happens when a reservation is made at a restaurant?Therestaurant would ask for the person’s name and contact details, the time ofarrival and the number of diners.The required tables or seats would bereserved.When the diners arrive they would be shown to their table.Thebusiness transaction would be completed when they have dined and paidtheir bill.It is business as usual.Right?Wrong.What I saw at the restaurant entrance bothered me.It showed that therestaurant does not treat its customers’ personal data with care – anyonecould see it.So what?Why would anyone care, you might ask?Well, it might not matter for many of us who are just ordinary folks.Butto a celebrity or VIP making a reservation at the restaurant, this could be abig concern.From the exposed data, anyone could potentially know who therestaurant’s important customers are and their contact numbers.They coulddo anything they like with that information.Retaining personal data longer than necessaryIn addition to reasonably protecting personal data, the data protection lawrequires an organisation to “cease to retain” personal data when it is nolonger necessary for a legal or business purpose.So what happens to the reservation list after the reservation dates?Doesthe restaurant keep it or dispose of it?If the restaurant disposes of theinformation, does it do so securely so that it continues to be protected?Or isit thrown into the dustbin without shredding?Using personal data without consentThe personal data collected for a restaurant reservation cannot be used forany other purpose or disclosed without the consent of the relevant individual.If the restaurant keeps the reservation list, if it is filed away for reference,why and for how long?Does the restaurant use the personal data in thereservation list for other purposes, like marketing, without the knowledge orconsent of the relevant individual?Does the restaurant give or even sell theinformation to a third-party and, if so, for what purposes?Complaints to the regulatorIt’s clear to me that this restaurant is failing to comply with at least one of theobligations under the data protection law – the obligation to protect personaldata.It may well be failing to comply with all of the obligations highlightedabove!Under a “complaints-based regime”1 all it takes is for somebody tocomplain to the data protection regulator about this restaurant and theregulator will be compelled to investigate.Where the regulator has insteadset up an investigation, the regulator might observe the restaurant’sinappropriate data protection practices and investigate on its own initiative.In either case, fines and order for corrective action may follow.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations handling personal data of individuals should do the following to protect thedata:■■■■■Do an onsite audit – walk around the premises and see where personal data might beinadvertently disclosed to third-parties.For example, contact information on reservationlists should be concealed from public view.Adopt effective operational practices to close operational compliance gaps identifiedduring the audit.Dispose of personal data when it is no longer necessary for a legal or business purpose.Do not use personal data collected for one purpose (such as a restaurant reservation)for any other purpose (such as email marketing) without the consent of the relevantindividual.Train your employees so that operations are compliant and they can recognise potentialoperational compliance failures and remediate them.1A complaints-based regime is one where the regulator does not carry out audits orinvestigations on its own initiative but instead acts to investigate complaints made to it byindividuals.Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Commission takes a complaints-basedapproach.12",,," What does the data protection law require an organisation to protect?

56,56,Safeguarding privacy during data,"collectionFilling in forms and making entries in specially designated record books arethe two most common methods used by organisations to collect personal datafrom individuals.There are a number of “data collection points” where suchactivities occur, such as:■■■■■■■when visitors, contractors or service providers fill in the visitors’ recordbook at the security guard post of a condominium or at the receptioncounter of an office buildingwhen buyers visit a show flat at a property launch and the salespersonshelp them to fill in an expression-of-interest formwhen prospective clients meet face-to-face with financial planningadvisers who help them to fill in a know-your-client formwhen individuals submit their application forms at the service provider’scounterwhen job seekers submit their job application forms to an organisationwhen shoppers drop lucky draw participation forms into a box or slot ata shopping mall andwhen new patients register themselves at a doctor’s clinic.Have you seriously observed how the “data collection points” are locatedand designed in organisations, and how the data collection processes areexecuted?You may be amazed to learn that in a number of organisations thereis scant attention paid to the privacy of your personal data at these “datacollection points”.Visitors’ record bookVisitors’ record books usually have column headings indicating theinformation requested and horizontal ruled lines for each visitor to fill in,one row at a time.Whenever visitors add their own personal contactinformation to the record book, they will inevitably see the personal detailsof earlier visitors.This is likely an unauthorised disclosure of earliervisitors’ personal data. (Some people may argue that earlier visitorsimplicitly consented to the data disclosure by adding their personal contactinformation voluntarily, while knowing that later visitors would see it.Insome circumstances that might be the case, but not when they were given noreal choice to opt-out.)Organisations should protect the privacy of their visitors.For example,they could do either of the following:■■Have individual forms for visitors to fill in, one form for each visitor.Have an electronic device for visitors to provide their personal contactinformation.They should make sure that the screen is shielded from othervisitors who are queueing behind the visitor using the device.Theyshould also ensure that the software does not allow the current visitor touse the “back” arrow key to look at the previous entries.Gathering information face-to-faceAn organisation’s representative, such as a real estate salesperson orfinancial planning adviser, may meet face-to-face with prospective clients.The representative asks the prospective clients questions to better understandtheir needs.The ideal place for such discussions is an enclosed room whereno one can eavesdrop on the conversation.But at times this may not bepossible, such as where an organisation seeks clients in a public or semi-public place, as in a show flat or a booth at an exhibition or trade fair.Theorganisation should make sure that its representative takes precautionarymeasures, such as the following:■■Locate the discussion area away from the main flow of human traffic, asfar as possible.Ensure that the representative’s notes about the prospective client cannotbe easily viewed by people around.This is often overlooked, especiallywhere the notes are taken down using a laptop computer.Drop-in box or slotRetailers and shopping centres often have boxes or slots for shoppers to dropin lucky draw forms with their contact information and other personal data.The organisation collecting the personal data should protect it by takingprecautionary measures, such as the following:■■■When retailers give shoppers lucky draw forms to fill in, they shouldprovide a place – perhaps a separate counter or table – where theshoppers can do this out of view of other shoppers.The drop-in box should not have transparent sides that allow anypasserby to take a peek inside and see the personal data of shoppers.The drop-in slot should be one-way and narrow enough so that nopasserby can fish out lucky draw forms from the box.Service counterIn today’s business culture of customer friendliness, organisations designtheir offices to avoid putting a barrier between their employees and theircustomers.They may, for example, install low service counters.Whenprospective customers submit application forms for the organisation’sservices it may be fairly easy for them to view other forms that are justbehind the counter.The organisation should protect such personal data bytaking precautionary measures to prevent later customers from inadvertentlyseeing it, such as the following:■■Shield the application forms and other confidential documents from thepublic eye by covering them with an opaque material or putting them in afile.Tilt computer screens used by employees away from the line-of-sight ofthe public.Registration counterI have heard of an alarming experience of a patient’s visit to a doctor’s clinicfrom a data protection perspective.The patient arrived early for theappointment, being scheduled as the first appointment for the day.No otherpatients were in the waiting room.No one was sitting at the reception deskyet.But a patient’s file was left unattended on the service counter next to thereception desk.The patient could have simply picked it up and read it orwalked away with it.Moral of the storyFrom the anecdotes I have shared, we can see that it is fairly easy fororganisations to collect an individual’s personal data in a range ofcommonplace situations.But organisations should be aware that the dataprotection law requires them to do so in a way that protects the personaldata.They should also be aware of most individuals’ desire for theorganisations to respect their privacy during the data collection process.For both of these reasons, organisations should carefully andconscientiously think about the physical or operational circumstances thatapply when their employees are collecting personal data.They shouldrequire their employees to be discreet and to take precautionary measures toprotect personal data when they are collecting it.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should safeguard the personal data they collect at the various “datacollection points”:Visitors’ record book■■Shield the personal data of earlier visitors from subsequent visitors.Better still, use individual paper forms or individual screens on electronic devices.Face-to-face meetings■■Prevent eavesdropping by locating the discussion area away from the flow of humantraffic.Shield discussion notes and computer screens to prevent unauthorised viewing.Drop-in box or slot■■Use a non-transparent drop-in box to prevent unauthorised viewing.Have a narrow, one-way slot to prevent hands from going in.Service counter■■Shield confidential documents from the public eye.Tilt computer screen away from the line-of-sight of the public.Registration counter■ Have the registration counter attended at all times and do not leave personal data lyingaround.13Lucky draws – do you need to know so",,," What are the two most common methods to collect

57,57,much about me?,"There are instances where individuals take great pains to write their personaldata down on paper accurately and legibly.They complete all data fieldswithout questioning the need for the requested information.One such instanceis when they complete a “lucky draw” entry form.The reason for this is verysimple.They want to be absolutely sure that if they do win a prize in thedraw, the organiser can contact them quickly and then easily verify theiridentity.They also want to be absolutely sure that they will not bedisqualified from winning for failing to provide all the information requestedby the organiser.Organisations exploiting human psychologySome organisers of lucky draws are shrewd enough to understand thispsychological behaviour of humans to be able to exploit the situation.Theyinclude additional data fields in the lucky draw entry form that are notreasonably necessary for the purpose of the lucky draw.Instead, they seek theinformation for the purpose of future targeted marketing to individuals.Forexample, the organiser might include questions to gauge participants’ fashiontastes and trends or their likes and dislikes of various electronic gadgets.The unsuspecting participants feel compelled to provide the requestedinformation for fear that they may not be eligible to win a prize if they submitan incomplete entry form.Individuals challenging excessive collection of personal dataBut things are changing.With greater awareness of their rights under the dataprotection law, individuals are challenging organisations on the need toprovide personal data that seems to be beyond what the organisation needsfor a particular purpose.Organisers of lucky draws are not immune fromthese challenges.Individuals increasingly demand that organisations give them a choicewhether or not to respond to the requests for information that does not seemto be relevant.In the case of lucky draws, that means individuals aredemanding an approach where they are not barred from taking part in thelucky draw even if they choose not to complete the data fields that are notreasonably necessary for the purpose of the draw.Using or disclosing personal data about lucky draw winnersThe terms and conditions of a lucky draw might state that the organiser willnotify winners by contacting them.Alternatively, they might state thatwinners’ details will be published in a particular place – such as in aparticular newspaper or on a particular website – on a specified date.Andthat winners should then contact the organisation to claim their prizes.The organiser should consider obtaining consent from participants tocontact them or publish their personal data should they win a prize in thelucky draw.The organiser might do this by seeking the individuals’ expressconsent to their personal data being used (for contact) or disclosed (bypublication) or might decide that the data protection law permits it to rely onimplied or deemed consent.Publication of winners’ detailsIf the organiser chooses to notify lucky draw winners by publishing theirdetails it should disclose just enough personal data for individuals to identifythemselves as winners of the competition.For example, an organisation might choose to publish only the winners’names – perhaps only their family name and initials – and the last, say, threedigits of their identity card numbers.This is sufficient for individuals toeither know with certainty that they are winners or, if they have a commonname, to know that they should enquire with the competition organiser to findout if they are indeed a winner.Even in those cases where their name isunusual and might therefore identify them, at least the organisation has notdisclosed their identity card number.Data protection lessonsFrom the above illustration we can see two principles of the data protectionlaw at play:■■■Do not over-collect personal data beyond the primary purpose for whichthe personal data is to be used – that is, in the case of lucky draws, tonotify winners by contacting them or notifying them by publication andthen to verify their identities when they come forward to claim theirprizes.One expert has opined that the mere intent of the organisers to collectmarket-related data beyond the primary purpose of the lucky draw, eventhough data subjects are given a choice to opt-out, may constitute afailure to comply with the data protection law.Do not over-disclose personal data beyond the primary purpose – that is,in the case of lucky draws, to notify the winners.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisers of lucky draws should adopt the following practices:■■■Do not require individuals to provide more personal data than is reasonably necessary toparticipate in the draw.Allow the participants to opt-out of providing additional personal data for purposesbeyond the lucky draw (for example, marketing purposes).Disclose just enough personal data of the winners to notify them and verify theiridentities.14",,," What is the reason for this?

58,58,Excessive collection of personal data in a,"sales engagement“Hello, I would like to get an insurance quotation,” an individual asked aninsurance company.“Sure.Before we proceed, can you please provide us with your date andplace of birth and your mother’s maiden name for security purposes?”“But I am only seeking a quotation and I don’t have any insurance policywith your company.Do you need all that information?”“It is a requirement under the data protection law for us to ask suchquestions as a security measure.”Extent of collection of personal dataWhat are your thoughts on this phone conversation?It’s imaginary, but it isbased on a complaint lodged with the Irish Privacy Commission1.Under the data protection law, an organisation is not permitted to collectpersonal data that is not reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it isbeing collected.Here, the individual complained that the insurance companywas asking for an excessive amount of personal data when she contactedthem by telephone seeking a quote for pet insurance.The regulator’s viewThe regulator:■■informed the insurance company that there was no requirement under thedata protection law for it to collect date of birth, mother’s maiden nameand place of birth data when a person phones for a quotation – especiallyfor pet insurance!said that any personal data collected is limited to what is adequate,relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for■which it is collected andsaid that telling an individual that the collection of such information wasa requirement under the data protection law was both false andmisleading and a misrepresentation of the requirements of the dataprotection law.The outcomeThe regulator required the insurance company to:■■cease using its ID verification screen at quotation stage andundertake not to seek information in the future at the quotation stageregarding a caller’s date and place of birth and mother’s maiden name.The data protection law constrains sales organisationsSales organisations have an understandable desire to collect as muchpersonal data as possible from any and all individuals with whom they comeinto contact.Personal data about potential prospects is in many ways the life-blood of their business.But, as the case study above demonstrates, because of the data protectionlaw, organisations should consider the stages throughout the sales-cycle atwhich it is reasonably necessary to collect personal data.In particular, theyshould take care not to collect too much personal data too early in the sales-cycle.In our consulting work, we have noticed excessive collection of personaldata too early in the sales-cycle – namely, at the prospecting or quotationstage – by property agents and financial advisers, for example.Excessive zeal by property agentsAt property roadshows and seminars, property agents typically ask prospectsto complete a “sales interest” or similar form.It often requests excessiveinformation such as the individual’s identity card number, informationrelating to properties they own, their previous property transactions and eventheir financial status.If the purpose of the “sales interest” form is to provide the property agentwith a record of individuals who are open to contact from them after theroadshow or seminar, of course individuals’ names and contact details arerequired.Their identity card numbers are certainly not required.Whether collecting information about their existing property portfolio isreasonably necessary is questionable, though some high-level informationmight be sought legitimately if an appropriate purpose for collecting it isnotified by the organisation to the individual (by stating it in the “salesinterest” form).If so, organisations should consider the least privacy-intrusive way of collecting it.For example, instead of seeking details of properties owned by theindividual as a way of gauging their wealth or their future purchasinginterests, the organisation might be able to get relevant information by simplyasking individuals to specify the property price ranges in which they might beinterested:Please tick the property price range(s) about which you would likeus to contact you:under $500,000$500,000 to $5 millionover $5 millionExcessive zeal by financial advisersIn many jurisdictions, financial advisers are required to have their clientscomplete a “Know Your Client (KYC)” form before they provide them withfinancial advice.The KYC process is directed at ensuring that the adviserunderstands their clients’ needs and provides financial advice that isappropriate to them.However, the first inquiry individuals make to financial advisers is oftenquite preliminary, such as a question about what financial products are withinthe scope of the adviser’s business.Similar to seeking an insurance quote,the individual is making a preliminary enquiry to find out whether or not toenter into a more detailed conversation with the organisation.But many financial advisers ask individuals to complete a KYC formbefore they will respond to any enquiry, even if the individual is clearly justat the exploratory stage of learning what financial products the adviser maybe able to sell to the individual.The adviser may genuinely believe that theKYC form must be completed before they are permitted to respond to even abasic and preliminary enquiry.From the perspective of the data protection law, it makes no difference ifthe financial adviser has genuinely misunderstood the KYC process or iftheir aim is to collect as much personal data from every prospect as possible.In either case, the financial adviser will fail to comply with the dataprotection law if they collect more personal data than is reasonably requiredat any stage of their sales process.In addition, of course, they may beirritating their prospect and not contributing to the rapport they should bebuilding to help win the sale.The tension between data protection and building a sales databaseIt is true that many requests for a quote or for preliminary information andexpressions of interest in talking to a sales agent may just be individualsshopping around for the best price and value or otherwise for the best deal.Meanwhile, sales organisations are keen to create databases to generateleads, including to follow up later to offer them other deals that might interestthem.And, sometimes, it is undeniably convenient – for both an organisationand their new client – for the organisation to have already collected personaldata about that client when a contact results in a sale for the organisation.But the data protection law seeks to balance the right of individuals toprotect their personal data and the need for organisations to collect it forreasonable purposes.Collecting personal data from individuals that isexcessive in regard to the stage of the sales-cycle at which it is collected isnot permitted by the data protection law.Organisations should therefore adapt their sales approach and techniquesaccordingly.Bridging the tension between data protection and sales needsYou might decide to seek consent to collect and use personal data earlier inthe sales-cycle than would otherwise be possible under the data protectionlaw.However, the balance between, say, building a database and irritatingpotential customers comes very much into focus.Here’s another imaginaryconversation, this time with a financial adviser:“Hello, I would like to find out if you are able to offer life insuranceproducts,” an individual asks a financial adviser.“No, we don’t at the moment, though we might do so from next yearonwards.We do offer investment products issued by some very prominentlocal banks.Would you like us to provide you with some information aboutthem?”“No, I’m really not interested in investment products right now and Iwant to get life insurance quite soon.”“OK, I understand.Would you like us to add you to our mailing list sothat we can send you email updates about our product offerings from time totime?You’ll be able to unsubscribe from it at any time if you no longer wantto receive our updates.”Similarly, if you want to use personal data collected at any stage in the sales-cycle for sales purposes other than the original purpose intended by theprospect, you can do so if you first get the individual’s consent.You shouldnotify them if you intend to do so, state the purposes clearly and get theirconsent to that purpose.Nobody likes surprises, especially if it involvestheir personal data and they feel that an organisation uses it unfairly orwithout their knowledge.Instead of looking at the data protection law as a barrier to sales,understand it and use it so that you turn it into a competitive edge vis-à-visyour competitors.Position yourself as a trusted adviser – and that includesgetting individuals to trust you when it comes to their personal data!A quick comment on disposing of personal dataThe more personal data you have in your possession, the moreresponsibilities you have under the data protection law because it requiresyou to protect it.The law also requires you to “cease to retain” it when it’sno longer necessary for a legal or business purpose.You should dispose of itsecurely, such as by shredding, so that you protect it during disposal.As anexample, a financial penalty of $1,000 was imposed on a former financialconsultant for failing to take reasonable security measures to protect thepersonal data of his clients when disposing of their insurance policy-relateddocuments.He threw them away in the dustbin.2 These requirements extendto all the notes you scribbled about your leads – their appointment dates,concerns, preferences and requirements.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations collecting personal data of prospects, customers and other individualsshould adopt the following practices:■■■■■■Do not collect excessive amounts of personal data in the early stage of the sales-cycle.Only collect personal data beyond contact details at the time when it is necessary, suchas when you close the sale and are required to complete any relevant sales agreement.Do not use the data protection law as an excuse for collecting personal data, even whendoing so is not false or misleading or a misrepresentation.Engender trust by explaining to individuals why you are collecting their personal data andhow you will use and/or disclose it.Get the prospect’s consent if you want to use their personal data for other sales ormarketing purposes.Written consent is best because it can be proven.Verbal consentthat is confirmed in writing may also be able to be proven, depending on thecircumstances.Protect personal data in your possession and dispose of it securely when it is no longernecessary for a legal or business purpose.12The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, Ireland, https://www.dataprotection.ie/,2011

59,59,Excessive collection of personal data in an,"online membership formMany organisations tend to collect excessive information as part of aregistration or initial sign-up process.While collecting basic informationsuch as the individual’s name and email address would be sufficient for thepurpose for which they are collecting and will be using the personal data,they collect additional information for statistical purposes.Do you often encounter websites that ask intrusive questions and evenrequire excessive information when you want to join their membership orcommunity?What happens when you refuse to provide the informationbecause it is too personal or irrelevant?Does the site prevent you fromcompleting the registration process?One individual complained to the regulator when this happened to him.An online travel portal did not allow him to complete the online membershipregistration process because he refused to provide personal data that he feltwas excessive for the purpose of registration on the site1.It was mandatoryfor registrants to provide as part of the registration process:■■■■■■OccupationEducation levelMarital statusPersonal monthly incomeFamily monthly incomeNumber of family membersThe privacy policy for the portal did not state the purpose for collecting thepersonal data.The organisation told the regulator that the collection was forstatistical purposes only.■The regulator ruled that:individuals have the right to decide whether or not to provide personaldata that is required for the statistical purposes of an organisation and■if an individual refuses to provide personal data that is sought forstatistical purposes the organisation should not for that reason deny themaccess to the goods and/or services sought by them.As a result, the organisation added the statistical purpose to its privacypolicy.It also amended its web page, making it optional for individuals toprovide the personal data that it sought for statistical purposes.The data protection law and the online environmentThe data protection law applies online to the same extent that it applies in a“bricks and mortar” environment.They apply to online collection of personaldata to the same extent as they apply when individuals complete paper formsor provide personal data verbally.They apply to organisations that have anonline presence or that are online businesses.Collecting personal data for statistical/marketing purposes“Statistical purposes” is frequently a perfectly legitimate purpose for anorganisation to collect personal data.The purpose for collecting personal data sought by an organisation’smarketing department might be described as “statistical purposes” or it mightbe described as “marketing purposes”.It is behavioural, demographic andpsychographic information, which can be invaluable for advertising andtargeted marketing campaigns.It may result in more effective marketing bythe organisation, which saves the organisation money.It also saves theindividual from being bothered by marketing messages that are not of interestto them.Personal data described as being “for statistical purposes” might equallybe sought by an organisation’s planning or finance department – demographicinformation can be invaluable for an organisation planning expansion of itsnumber of business outlets or planning how to deliver its services in thefuture.The organisation benefits by optimal use of its resources.Individualsbenefit from the organisation being able to plan around expected capacityconstraints or being able to provide their goods and services in convenientways and from convenient locations.Notification of purpose is keyUnder the data protection law, organisations that want to collect personaldata for statistical purposes, including for marketing purposes, should notifyindividuals of that purpose.As a matter of good practice, this should be done at the point ofcollection – the website in the above example could have included a questionmark icon next to each relevant data field and give individuals a “clickthrough” to the organisation’s privacy policy or statement.In any event, thepurpose should be disclosed clearly in its privacy policy or statement.Optional requests for personal data is also keyForcing individuals to provide additional personal data as mandatory fieldsin a registration process creates customer resistance.As in the aboveexample, it can result in complaints to the regulator.But it also results inmany potential customers not completing the registration process becausethey refuse to satisfy excessive requests for personal data.And having manycustomers who complete it grudgingly so that they can complete a registrationis far from the best way of starting a customer relationship.In addition, of course, the regulator has made it clear that fieldsrequesting personal data for statistical purposes should be marked asoptional – the individual should be given a choice whether or not to provideinformation that an organisation requests for statistical purposes.Optional requests may still be excessive requestsMarking a data field as “optional” is not a magic bullet.Making fieldsoptional doesn’t mean that an organisation may collect any informationwithout regard to purpose and relevance.Even where provision of personaldata is optional there is a balance to be struck under the data protection lawbetween the right of individuals to protect their personal data and the needfor organisations to collect, use or disclose it.Otherwise, marking data fieldsas “optional” can easily be abused, not least because studies show thatindividuals are more likely than not to provide personal data that is markedas “optional”.An organisation that wants to collect personal data for statisticalpurposes needs to be able to justify its requests in terms of relevance fromthe organisation’s business perspective.For example, it’s unlikely that itwould be reasonable for an e-commerce site selling women’s shoes to knowthe names of all family members and their birthdates.But it might bereasonable for an e-commerce site selling computer games to know thenames of family members interested in computer games and their birthdates ifit would provide them with a free link on their birthday to a game that mightbe age-appropriate for them.Tips about expressing the purpose for collecting personal dataOrganisations should take due care when specifying the purpose(s) for whichthey will collect, use or disclose personal data, including where it is part ofa membership scheme.We have seen purposes expressed as “valid business or marketingreasons” or as “in the way we see fit at our discretion”.This is unlikely to beconsidered valid notification of purpose under the data protection law – itdoes not really indicate to individuals how the organisation may collect, useor disclose their personal data.In any event, you should not assume that your organisation has the right todo what it wants with personal information.Especially where a notificationof purpose is too generic.The purpose should express the outcome – forexample, to send newsletters, invitation to events or provide special offers.If the organisation intends to disclose or sell the personal data to a third-party, individuals need to be informed and be given a choice to opt-out or towithdraw their consent.Adding individuals to your databaseSince we are on the topic of memberships, not everyone wants to be includedin a membership system or be part of an online marketing database.Forexample, in our consulting work we have seen cases where organisationsautomatically add individuals to their email database when they make onlinequeries.An organisation must get consent from the individual before usingpersonal data provided for the purpose of responding to an online query forthe different purpose of marketing to them using the organisation’s emaildatabase.Protecting personal data in electronic form – encryptionIf an organisation collects personal data online, the data should betransmitted securely from the online form to the organisation’s database.Thisis because the data protection law places an obligation on an organisation totake reasonable measures to protect personal data, including personal data inelectronic form.An organisation’s database should usually be encrypted to protect it.Where personal data is sensitive, such as financial information, the need toencrypt it is even more important on the basis that encryption would morelikely be a reasonable measure to take in order to protect the personal data.As part of taking reasonable security measures to protect personal data, itis often reasonable for an organisation to do a security assessment of itswebsite (such as a vulnerability assessment or a penetration test) from timeto time.Protecting personal data in electronic form – passwords and other accesscontrolsAny database maintained by an organisation should be password-protectedso that access to it is restricted to employees who “need to know” – that is,they need to have access to it in order to do their jobs.Stated another way,organisations need to ensure that only authorised users can access personaldata.We have seen many organisations that have no access and securitycontrols in place.Any employee in, say, the marketing department has accessto any file maintained by the organisation.They can find a file containingpersonal data that the organisation collected for a non-marketing purpose,download it and use the personal data for marketing purposes.They can evensend files to unauthorised third-parties as email attachments.This can be both a failure to comply with the data protection law and avulnerability in the organisation’s general business practices – for example,there is nothing to prevent disgruntled employees from sharing information inthe database with a competitor or from using it to set up their own business incompetition with the organisation.We see similar problems arising in organisations that provide services,such as secretariat services, to other organisations.They hold filescontaining the personal data of members of each organisation to which theyprovide services.If files are not carefully protected, an employee could usepersonal data of members of one organisation for the purposes of anotherorganisation. (This is similar to a call centre engaged by severalorganisations and receiving their client lists as call lists.Without accesscontrols, employees might use a call list received from one client to makecalls for another client.)The multiplier effect of excessive personal dataCollecting excessive personal data exacerbates the issues and vulnerabilitiesdiscussed here.Organisations have responsibilities in connection with thepersonal data that they hold – the more data they hold, the larger theresponsibilities.Not forgetting that the possibilities and impact of a databreach are also much higher.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESWhen collecting the personal data of individuals for business purposes, organisationsshould adopt the following practices:■■■■■■■Notify individuals of the purposes for which you collect, use or disclose personal dataand obtain their consent.Do not collect excessive personal data.Include the purposes for collecting, using or disclosing personal data in your privacynotice.State clearly which data fields are optional if you collect personal data for statisticalpurposes.Ensure that optional data requests are not excessive and that they are reasonablyrelated to your business.Perform regular security assessments of your website.Ensure that personal data istransmitted securely from your website or online portal to your organisation’s database.Ensure that the databases are encrypted.Ensure that access to your organisation’s databases is restricted to employees whohave a “need to know” in order to do their jobs.1PCPD case notes: Ref No.:2011C06.https://www.pcpd.org.hk 16",,," What do many organisations tend to collect excessive information as part of aregistration or initial sign-up process?

61,61,excessive personal data?,"World-4-Kids1 offers fun and entertainment for children – they can pretend tobe in a particular occupation, such as a teacher, police officer, fire-fighter,doctor or pilot and experience what life would be like in that occupation.Ithas various “stations” where the children can participate in activities.Forexample, at the petrol station they can play as attendants to fill up the motorvehicles of other children bringing their vehicles in for a refill.Each stationis sponsored by a well-known commercial brand.I recently visited World-4-Kids with my two children.While they wereexcited about visiting a make-believe world where they could role-playvarious occupations, I was looking forward to seeing how World-4-Kidswould handle their personal data.Personal data nicely secured and used for the right reasonsLo and behold, I was rather impressed by how World-4-Kids handledpersonal data.World-4-Kids collected the usual personal details when wepurchased tickets online, namely the ages and names of the customers.World-4-Kids did not ask for any passport or identity card number when I purchasedthe tickets.It did not ask for any additional information when we arrived atWorld-4-Kids either.We were each given a security wrist band that resembled a wrist watch.Our personal data was transferred to it.As we visited each station World-4-Kids employees scanned our wrist band into a dedicated workstation to keeptrack of what stations each child visited.No personal data was physicallyexchanged, reducing any risk of information leakage or accidental disclosure.My son chose to be a fire-fighter so we headed off to the in-house firestation where there was already a queue.I was told that the wait would takemore than an hour.I agreed to it as this was a highlight for my son – he wouldget to ride in a mini fire engine (complete with loud sirens) and he wouldhave a chance to put out “fires”.I was not sure whether to leave my son in the dedicated queueing area.Itwas supervised by World-4-Kids employees so there was really no need tobe physically there to accompany him.Nevertheless, I was concerned aboutleaving him alone.I was impressed when World-4-Kids employees assuredme that there was no need to worry because he was wearing his wrist band.It was not easy to dislodge it.Therefore, he would not be able to leaveWorld-4-Kids without triggering off alerts.Hmm, personal data used for theright security reasons, I thought.World-4-Kids’ WiFi serviceSo my experience of World-4-Kids as far as personal data was concernedwas a good one.Until I tried accessing their public WiFi service.I was surprised that I had to input personal data such as my emailaddress, mobile number and my date of birth just to use it.Whatever for?World-4-Kids’ WiFi service was managed by a third-party serviceprovider.It was disconcerting to learn that the third-party could disclose mypersonal data to:■■World-4-Kids andthe sponsors of World-4-Kids – that is, to the sponsor of each station.To be fair to the WiFi service provider, the bulk of the policy was verytransparent with regard to how it collects, uses and discloses personal data.The policy stated that:We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to use yourdata, to provide you with information about goods and services thatmay be of interest to you .We will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) withinformation about goods and services .Where We permit selected third parties to use your data, We (or they)will only contact you by electronic means .But, the WiFi service provider also made the point that:If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass yourdetails on to third parties for marketing purposes then you should notuse our wifi Service .They unfairly tied the use of their WiFi service by individuals visitingWorld-4-Kids to receiving marketing messages from them and from otherthird-parties.There was no choice to opt-out of receiving them.Any consentI gave them would not likely be valid under the data protection law, but thatwas cold comfort – my personal data would still have been used for the WiFiprovider’s marketing purposes and disclosed by them to other third-parties.Closing remarksBoth World-4-Kids and its selected WiFi service provider still have a longway to go in terms of personal data protection.Seriously, how many of us actually bother to read the fine print in aprivacy policy?Well, with the data protection law firmly in place, we shouldread it.Then we can decide not to use services that require us to provide ourpersonal data unnecessarily and who opt to use and disclose it for marketingpurposes.Or we can file a complaint with the regulator.Either way we havea role in improving practices about the collection, use and disclosure of ourpersonal data.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations working with service providers of WiFi services (or any other services) totheir customers should ensure that their service providers:■■■■comply with the requirements of the data protection lawdo not collect excessive data from customersdo not disclose any personal data collected from customers to any third-party except asapproved by them and stated accordingly in the privacy policy, anddo not use any personal data collected from customers for any purpose not stated in theprivacy policy.Individuals should:■■always read the privacy policy of the WiFi service they are accessing andrefrain from using WiFi services to conduct

record cards.The regulator found that the property management company for the buildingdid have proper procedures in place where proper visitors’ record cardswere used and no third-party could access the personal information of othervisitors.However, the stock of record cards had run out.The security guardhad photocopied only part of a record card and had used these copies.Hencethe security guard was not following the proper procedures.As a result, the security guard apologised for the inconvenience caused tothe complainant.The complainant’s card was destroyed.The organisationrevised its internal memo guidelines for its employees and reminded them ofits requirement for strict compliance with its proper procedures for visitors.Hence, the regulator considered the matter to be resolved effectivelythrough mediation and decided that further investigation of the case wasunnecessary.Security guards who talk too muchTry asking security guards of a condominium how much they know aboutcertain residents or tenants and you will be surprised, especially if you havecome to know the security guard over time.Then you will likely get whatever“juicy details” they happen to know about owners and tenants.Some of the“juicy details” are likely to be an unauthorised disclosure of personal data.Sometimes people talk too much even when you don’t know them.In anaudit for data breaches we did for a client I asked a security guard about atenant to find out if personal data would be disclosed.The security guardwillingly gossiped and disclosed personal data about the tenant to me.Thesecurity guard evidently assumed that I was the owner of the relevant condounit asking about my own tenant.Even if I had been the owner, the securityguard likely was not entitled to disclose the tenant’s personal data to mewithout the tenant’s consent.“Social engineering”, in the context of information security, is the art ofmanipulating people so they give us personal data.I didn’t set out to do anysocial engineering when I asked the security guard about a tenant.Someindividuals deliberately embark on social engineering and they are verysuccessful.Many individuals, obviously including the security guard, areeasily susceptible to social engineering and can be tricked into releasingpersonal data that they are not authorised to.Where there is an unauthorised disclosure of personal data, it makes nodifference if the disclosure results from social engineering or other trickery.Visitors’ sign-in books displayed openlyVisitors’ sign-in books are common at the security posts of commercialbuildings and organisations.Visitors are asked to fill in their details uponentry in the book.When they do so, they see the personal data of individualswho signed in on the same page before them.And sometimes they can evenflick back to earlier pages to see who signed in on previous days.Outside a voluntary welfare organisation, I noticed a volunteer browsingthe pages of the visitors’ sign-in book.They must have spent five minuteslooking at it.One of our property clients caught a property agent taking photos of theregistration information in a showroom.Visitors’ sign-in books are agoldmine to sales people, especially if they contain contact details.In any of these types of circumstances, the organisation that “owns” thevisitors’ sign-in book is likely liable for any failure to comply with the dataprotection law by reason of the unauthorised disclosure of personal data.Two companies got into trouble for failure to put in place reasonablemeasures to prevent unauthorised access to a visitor logbook containingpersonal data, which was left unattended by the security guards on duty.2Here’s another tip: the organisation should also take care about what itdoes with “old” visitors’ registers.It should have a policy about how it willstore them securely under lock and key, how long it will retain them and howit will dispose of the personal data in them securely.Unmanned guard postsIn many of our onsite audits of organisations for compliance with the dataprotection law we have seen unattended guard posts and security desks.Sometimes this is simply because the security guard is away for a fewminutes or has moved a few metres away while assisting another visitor.Other times it is because the post or desk is attended only after office hours.An organisation should take care to ensure that whenever a guard post orsecurity desk is unattended, a passerby or other individual is not able tobrowse through the visitors’ register, incident logs or other documents thatmay contain personal data.And that they are not able to look into unlockedcabinets or drawers.CCTV surveillance in full public viewMany organisations have CCTV surveillance systems.Where theorganisation has a security post or guardhouse, it is usually monitored by asecurity guard.When we did an audit at a shopping centre, we discovered that membersof the public could view the same live footage as the security guard.Themonitors were positioned such that they could be viewed by anyone passingby the security post.And what was particularly disconcerting was that thesecurity guard did not stop us or any curious onlookers from viewing themonitors.An organisation should take care to ensure that CCTV monitors can beviewed only by individuals who have a need to see it in order to do theirjobs.This clearly does not include members of the public.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should adopt the following measures to help ensure that the collection,usage and disclosure of personal data of visitors are protected:■■■■■Inform visitors of the purposes for collecting their personal data.This is usually donebest by displaying a notice at the building entrance, security post or guardhouse.Do not permit visitors to see the personal data of visitors preceding them.A securityguard could write down their personal data, rather than asking them to do it themselves.Or each visitor could be asked to complete a separate form for their own personal data.Ensure that visitors’ personal data is kept under lock and key and is securely destroyedwhen it is no longer necessary for a business or legal purpose.Ensure that security guards are trained, including to be able to explain to visitors why theorganisation needs to collect their personal data and how long the organisation will retainit.They should also be trained not to disclose any personal data during a conversationwith any individual other than organisation personnel with a “need to know” to carry outtheir jobs.Secure all personal

67,67,marketing techniques,"If you are a salesperson, you know that every year your sales target or quotagoes up.It’s inevitable.There are already enough pressures trying to meetyour sales goals and you look for new ways to generate sales leads.Any method of generating sales leads that does not comply with the dataprotection law will backfire on you and your organisation.This includes“techniques” to illegally, secretly or unfairly acquire personal data.A method that does not comply with the data protection law might evenwork for a short while.But it will inevitably get you and your organisationinto trouble.Someone will complain to the regulator and the regulator willinvestigate you and your organisation.An investigation will drain your time,energy and resources when they could be used better in concentrating yourefforts on meeting your sales goals.And if the regulator finds that your organisation did, as a result of youractions, fail to comply with the data protection law, the regulator may givesuch directions as it sees fit so that the organisation does comply with thelaw.The regulator may also impose a financial penalty on the organisation.Oh, and at this point your job security will likely be tenuous.Do not acquire personal data illegally or secretlyIn our experience, acquiring personal data illegally or secretly is probablythe most common method of sourcing leads that gets sales people into troubleunder the data protection law.They look for “creative” ways to acquirecustomer lists or leads.Many organisations and even individuals have facedregulatory action – in some jurisdictions, criminal or civil prosecution – forillegally or secretly collecting personal data.An estate agent and a director of SAI Property Investments Limited1 werefound guilty of committing such an offence under the UK’s Data ProtectionAct.They were found to have unlawfully obtained details about their tenantsfrom a rogue customer service adviser at Slough Borough Council.TheCouncil was also fined for supplying them with information relating toindividuals receiving a Housing and Council Tax Benefit.In another example, a man unlawfully obtained personal data of onlinebingo players2.The data set contained individuals’ names, addresses, emailaddresses, telephone numbers and user names.It was sold to him in 2008while he was working for an Israeli poker company.He later sold it on anindustrial scale for approximately £25,000, compromising the privacy ofmore than 65,000 online customers.He was fined for doing so.Do not access customer databases illegallyEverything Everywhere (EE) is a telecommunications company.A director ofthree marketing and telecommunications companies was fined3 after illegallyaccessing one of EE’s customer databases.He did this by impersonating amember of EE’s security team in calls and emails he made to EE.On one ofthem he was successful and got the passwords and log-in details of 1,066 ofEE’s customers.Apparently, he then logged in to the customer accounts andfound out when they were due for a mobile phone upgrade.Then he targetedthem with services offered by his own telecommunications companies.The Information Commissioner said: “Fines like this are no deterrent.Our personal details are worth serious money to rogue operators.If we don’twant people to steal our personal details or buy and sell them as they like,then we need to show them how serious we are taking this.And that meansthe prospect of prison for the most serious cases.”Do not acquire personal data through unfair or deceptive meansTwo individuals came up with a supposedly innovative way to acquire aqualified sales list4.They would sell the lists to claims managementcompanies looking for compensation cases to in turn pass on to lawyers whowould pay commission to the claims management company.To promote compensation claims for personal injury or paymentprotection, the two individuals spammed text messages such as the followingmessage without identifying the source of the message.In addition, despiteappearances to the contrary, they did not offer an effective way for recipientsto opt-out:CLAIM TODAY, you may be entitled to £3500 for the accident youhad.To CLAIM free reply CLAIM to this message.To opt out textSTOP .Most recipients ignored the messages.A few responded by enquiring about aclaim that could be sold to a claims management company.Many tried to opt-out, but by doing so they confirmed their telephone number as being “active”,making it more valuable to “list brokers”.The two individuals made asubstantial profit from the sale of personal data.Although it was overturnedon appeal, the regulator imposed a £440,000 fine.Collating customer data from all sources within the companyIn our advisory engagement with clients we have seen that sales andmarketing employees within an organisation sometimes collate personal dataabout potential customers from all sources within the organisation.For example, sales and marketing employees might downloadinformation about individuals from the organisation’s customer relationshipmanagement (CRM) system.And if it’s not included in the CRM system, theyalso download other information such as contact information generated bycorporate customer enquiries and customer support databases.They seek tomine these databases with the intention of running marketing campaigns,including by sending newsletters to individuals.If the organisation is holdinga marketing event, they will use email addresses to send out invitations toindividuals.If the individuals receiving newsletters and invitations to events have notconsented to their personal data being used for these marketing purposes theorganisation is likely failing to comply with the data protection law.Whenwe point this out we usually hear, “Yes, but it’s OK because our email systemlets recipients opt-out of receiving further emails and invitations from us”.The trouble is that enabling recipients to opt-out of receiving furtheremails and invitations does not in some way retroactively “fix” any failureby the organisation to comply with the data protection law when they weresent out.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations that acquire personal data to build and collate customer lists should adoptthe following practices:■■■■Do not acquire personal data illegally or secretly without individuals’ knowledge.Do not access customer databases without authorisation or illegally.This includestricking someone into providing access information, as well as using technologicalmeans to hack into databases.Do not acquire personal data by providing false or misleading information or by usingdeceptive or misleading practices.Do not take personal data that is collected for one purpose and use it for anotherpurpose without the consent of the relevant individual.Providing the individual with anopt-out option does not overcome the need for consent at the

69,69,to not collect excessive data,"All of us – companies and individuals – are creatures of habit.Or is itsimply laziness?I see many job application forms collect a wide range ofpersonal data without considering the data protection law.Some of thesepractices were carried over from the days before data protection laws cameinto effect.The thinking then was to collect as much personal data aspossible in the job application form, so that when the job applicant is hired,there is no need to collect additional data about the new employee.This is considered excessive collection of personal data in a number ofjurisdictions with data protection laws.For example, why would a hiringorganisation want to know the next-of-kin of the job applicant in theapplication form when the individual has not even been shortlisted as beingsuitable for the job?If a job candidate with many job options gets theimpression from a job application form that the organisation is collectingexcessive personal information about them, they will give preference to otheropportunities.Fair employment practices – selection only on the basis of merit and jobrequirementsSome jurisdictions have legislated fair employment practices such thatorganisations are not allowed to collect certain personal attributes about jobapplicants in the job application form.This is to prevent the organisationsfrom being biased towards/against certain personal attributes of the jobapplicant during the process of shortlisting them for the first job interview.It is now generally accepted business practice in a number ofjurisdictions to shortlist and select job applicants on the basis of merit, suchas skills, experience or ability to perform the job applied for.Personalattributes of job applicants that may bias hiring managers during theshortlisting and selection stages may not be collected, such as age, race,gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability.Selection criteria should be related to the job requirements to ensure that jobapplicants are fairly and objectively assessed on their job suitability, ratherthan be coloured by certain personal attributes.Reasons to update job application formsRevising job application forms to get rid of data requests that do not relate tothe applicant’s merit and the requirements of the job makes good businesssense.This is also in line with complying with data protection laws thatdiscourage excessive collection of personal data for the stated purpose ofdata processing.Non-excessive collection of personal data / Data minimisation principleIn a number of jurisdictions, the data protection law does not permitorganisations to collect personal data beyond what is reasonably required inthe circumstances.The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes itone step further by stating upfront that personal data can be collected only tothe extent that it is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for therelevant purpose – this is known as the “data minimisation principle”.Othercountries generally take one approach or the other, but the underlying thoughtis that “less is better”.In the case of a job application form, this means that an organisationshould collect only the information it needs to decide whether to invite theapplicant for an interview and to otherwise decide whether or not to hirethem.Other information such as the age, race, gender, religion, marital statusand next-of-kin of the job applicant may only be collected when the applicantis offered a job by the organisation and only to the extent that this otherinformation is reasonably required or necessary for the purposes of theemployment.Answering questions about why an organisation collects personal dataAn organisation should have a clear understanding of the reasons forcollecting each piece of personal data in a job application form.This is because the organisation must be able to answer questions aboutthe collection, use or disclosure of personal data in their business processes.Of course, any person with that responsibility must have the necessary clearunderstanding of why they need to collect certain personal data under thecircumstances, so that they can respond to these questions.Getting express consent to collect and use personal data in a jobapplication formSome jurisdictions require organisations to obtain express consent from jobapplicants to use their personal data in job application forms.In otherjurisdictions, such as Singapore, an organisation may rely on deemed consentfrom the job applicants to the collection, use and disclosure of their personaldata.Under deemed consent, the organisation would still be required toinclude in its job application form notification of its purpose for collectingand using the personal data of the job applicant, so that the job applicant iscognizant of what they are deemed to have consented to.In any case it isgood practice to ask the job applicant to sign on the job application form inorder to have documentary evidence of their consent (whether deemed ornot).Any express consent given by the job applicant to the organisationcollecting personal data beyond what is required for that purpose is likelynot valid.In addition, where an organisation collects personal data beyondwhat it is reasonably required, it will have failed to comply with the dataprotection law.Establishing a legal basis for processing personal data of a job applicantIn countries where the GDPR applies or where there similarly needs to be alegal basis for collecting personal data, consent is generally not effective asthe legal basis.This is because of the mismatch in power in the relationshipbetween the job applicant and the potential employer (or, when theindividual is employed, between the employer and the employee).And theconcept of freely given consent is not usually able to apply.However,another legal basis for processing is that it is in the “legitimate interests” ofthe organisation collecting, using and disclosing the personal data.Potentialemployers might rely on legitimate interests as a good legal basis forprocessing the personal data of a job applicant for the purpose of assessingtheir job applications.Some tips on what personal data an organisation cannot usually collectAn organisation should review its job application form and delete requestsfor information that is not reasonably required to enable the organisation todecide whether or not to invite the applicant for an interview and tootherwise decide whether or not to hire them.Additional information that the organisation needs to collect from theindividual it decides to hire can be collected from the individual before,when or immediately after they start work with the organisation.Here are examples of requests for information that I often see in jobapplication forms that are generally not necessary:■■■■Identity card or passport number – if identity needs to be confirmed at theinterview stage the interviewer should ask to sight the applicant’s identitycard or passport and can write in their interview notes that they haveconfirmed the applicant’s identity.Date of birth/age, race, gender, religion, marital status,languages/dialects spoken and family responsibilities – although theseare not general selection criteria there might be specific circumstanceswhere some of this information is relevant and, of course, age can usuallybe estimated by looking at the applicant’s educational qualifications andthe year they were obtained.Photograph of the job applicant – of course, if they are hired aphotograph might be collected later for a security access badge or for theorganisation’s intranet or other employee purpose.Nationality, place of birth, foreign passport number – it is often sufficientto ask a question such as “Are you entitled to work in <country name>?”or “Do you need to obtain any visa or other authorisation in order towork in <country name>?”at the interview stage.Similarly, I see questions such as “Have you ever suffered any physical ormental illness?”A more relevant question might be “Are you under anyphysical or mental disability that might adversely affect your ability to do thejob for which you are applying?”I also often see “Do you own a driver’slicence?”where a driver’s licence isn’t relevant to the job vacancy.Job application forms often ask for at least the name and contact detailsof an applicant’s next-of-kin or an emergency contact.Again, this is notreasonably required for making a hiring decision and, in any event, at theshortlisting and interview stage of recruitment there is no available exceptionto the need for consent.Where an individual is hired, an organisation can legitimately collect,use and disclose personal data about an employee to the extent that it isnecessary to do so, for example, perform the employment contract.Forexample, the employer can collect the employee’s bank account number sothat the employer can credit the employee’s salary directly to their bankaccount.A two-stage processWith the advent of the data protection law, the hiring process has transformedfrom:■ a one-stage process – a job application form that has:••all the information required to make a shortlisting/hiring decision andalmost all of the information required by the organisation if it hires theindividual – the usual exception is that the job application formdoesn’t include details of the individual’s bank account for directcredit of their salaryto:■ a two-stage process, which involves:••a job application form that has only the information required to make ashort listing/hiring decision andan employee data form that is filled up only by successful candidatesand that includes all of the information required by the organisation tomanage their employment relationship (including things such as taxoffice submissions, retirement benefits, direct credit of salary,calculation of leave benefits, provision of health and other insurancebenefits).CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESHiring managers and human resource personnel of organisations should adopt thefollowing practices in collecting, using or disclosing the personal data of job applicants:■■For business reasons, your organisation should review the job application form to makesure that it only collects personal data that is relevant to the job and reflects goodemployment practices.For compliance with the data protection law, your organisation should review the jobapplication form and delete requests for:••personal data that is not reasonably necessary for recruitment – shortlisting andselection – andpersonal data about third-parties■and adjust any questions that are over-broad or simply not relevant.Consider designing and implementing a two-stage process for collecting personal datafrom job applicants whom the organisation hires – at the shortlisting/selection stage, andat the job offer/acceptance stage.22",,," Why would a hiring organisation want to know the next-of-kin of the job applicant in the application form?

70,70,The trouble with third-party sources… of,"personal dataAn organisation may collect personal data about an individual from theindividual themselves or from someone else – that is, from a third-partysource.Examples of third-party sources of personal dataThird-party sources differ depending on what business or other activities arecarried out by an organisation, but here are some examples:■■■Database resellersIf you Google “selling marketing lists”, for example, you’ll get a host ofsearch results listing businesses advertising marketing lists, emailaddresses and other databases for sale.I looked at one sample list.I sawthat for individuals I could get their name together with their gender, dateof birth, email address, physical address and telephone number.I wasinvited to ask for a database according to my requirements.What a boonfor marketers! (We’ll get to the trouble with this shortly.)Customer referralsAn individual might allow an existing customer of a business to giveconsent to the business collecting their personal data.For example, it is acommon practice among multi-level marketing firms for the salespersonto ask for three referrals from each customer.Intra-group transfersWhere there is a company group structure, one company in the groupmight have a valid reason for disclosing personal data to anothercompany in the group.Let’s say SG Retail Sales Ltd collects personal data from individualswho shop in its store, but all the social media marketing for the group isdone by its subsidiary, SG Marketing Pte Ltd. SG Retail Sales Ltd■■collects the personal data directly from the individual.It discloses thepersonal data to SG Marketing Pte Ltd, which therefore collects it from athird-party source.Sales leadsIt is common business practice for salespersons to give each other“leads”. “Let me know”, a person selling mortgage loans might say to areal estate agent friend, “whenever you think you’ll sign up a sale of ahouse and the purchaser will need finance and I’ll give them a call”.Non-commercial referralsThird-party sources of personal data aren’t necessarily commerciallyfocused.For example, doctors routinely refer their patients to otherdoctors and to hospitals; hospitals routinely refer their patients for step-down care and other services; welfare organisations that are unable toassist a client routinely refer them to agencies and other voluntarywelfare organisations that may be able to assist them.So what is the trouble?As a matter of plain logic, whenever a collecting organisation collectspersonal data from a third-party, the third-party is disclosing that personaldata.The data protection law applies to both of them.For example, Kevin is a financial adviser and wants to collect personaldata from William, who is a real estate agent, about a potential homepurchaser, Lyn, so that Kevin can offer home financing to Lyn.William wantsto disclose personal data about Lyn to Kevin so that Lyn can get homefinancing for the house purchase to go ahead.Kevin is not permitted to collect the personal data without Lyn’s consentand William is not allowed to disclose personal data about Lyn without Lyn’sconsent1.The trouble is that the data protection law doesn’t allow Kevin, thefinancial adviser, to get off scot-free where William, the real estate agent,discloses Lyn’s personal data without consent to him.In that case, bothWilliam and Kevin can be liable for failure to comply with the dataprotection law.(William could suggest to Lyn that Kevin would be a good person to callabout home financing.Lyn is deemed to have given her consent by callingKevin herself.But here we are worried about the case where Kevin wants tobe able to call Lyn about the home financing.)Personal or domestic circumstancesThe data protection law does not apply to an individual acting in a personalor domestic capacity.“Give me your friend Jane’s phone number and I’ll call her and see if shewants to come to John’s birthday dinner with us next week” is OK.This isbecause both the discloser and the collector of Jane’s personal data areacting in a personal or domestic capacity.“Give me Jane’s phone number and I’ll call her and see if I can sell somelife insurance to her” is not OK.This is because the collector of Jane’spersonal data wants it for a business purpose.Business contact informationIn some countries, the data protection law does not apply to “businesscontact information”2.The information on an individual’s business name cardis usually all “business contact information” – their name, position title,business telephone number and business fax number, for example.But not ifthey provide it solely for a personal purpose.“Let me know”, a person selling mortgage loans might say to a real estateagent friend, “the purchaser’s name and office phone number whenever youthink you’ll sign up a sale of an office building for them to use for theirbusiness and the business will need finance and I’ll give them a call”.This isOK.It’s business contact information and the call will be made for businesspurposes.By contrast, “Let me know the purchaser’s name and office phone numberwhenever you think you’ll sign up a sale of a house and the purchaser willneed finance and I’ll give them a call” is not OK.This is because financing ahome purchase is a personal purpose.What the collecting organisation must doLet’s illustrate what the collecting organisation must do by using the aboveexample. (By the way, an individual can be “an organisation”, just as acompany or other entity can be “an organisation” in certain jurisdictions.)■■Notification: Before Kevin, the financial adviser, collects personal datafrom William, the real estate agent, Kevin must notify William of thepurposes for which he will be collecting, using or disclosing the personaldata (namely, to contact Lyn about home financing).This is so thatWilliam can be satisfied about the things listed below.Appropriate due diligence: Before collecting personal data fromWilliam, Kevin should make enquiries until he is satisfied about thethings listed below and document these enquiries so that he has evidenceon file about them.The things that both William and Kevin should satisfy themselves about arethat:■■Lyn has consented, expressly or implicitly, to her personal data – forexample name, contact details, and information that William knows aboutLyn’s financial circumstances – being disclosed by William and collected(and used) by Kevin for the purpose of Kevin calling Lyn about homefinancing orthe disclosure by William and the collection (and use) by Kevin can bedone without consent or the circumstances are such that the dataprotection law doesn’t apply (such as in the case of business contactinformation mentioned above).Evidence of what was doneAn additional key factor is that both William and Kevin should keep recordsabout what they have done to satisfy themselves about the consent.It is notenough, for example, for Kevin to simply trust that William has done the rightthing.After all, Lyn might not recall having given consent to William and thencomplain to the regulator when Kevin makes contact.In any investigation bythe regulator they will need evidence that they both did the right thing.Let’s say, for example, that Lyn gave verbal consent to William for thereferral to Kevin.In that case, William could confirm in writing (such as byan email) to Lyn that they had discussed the referral during such and suchmeeting and that Lyn had consented to it.Kevin could ask William to confirmin writing (again, such as by an email) that Lyn’s consent had been given toWilliam to make the referral.Ensuring accuracy when collecting data from a third-party sourceThe data protection law requires an organisation to make a reasonable effortto ensure that the personal data it collects is accurate and complete if thepersonal data is likely to be disclosed by the organisation to anotherorganisation.So, before collecting personal data from William, Kevin needs to decidewhat to do to satisfy the accuracy obligation.William’s reliability is onething for Kevin to take into account – is William usually quite painstaking ingetting things right or is William inclined to take a broadbrush approach?Kevin should consider whether to require William to confirm that Williamhas verified the accuracy and completeness of Lyn’s personal data,particularly the information about Lyn’s financial circumstances becauseKevin might be making a decision based on it.And Kevin should considerthe need to conduct further independent verification, including, in thisexample, checking with Lyn about the financial information.The trouble is that the accuracy obligation also applies to Kevin.It is noexcuse for Kevin to say, “But I got this personal data about Lyn from Williamand I trusted William to give me good data”.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations that collect personal data from third-party sources should adopt the followingpractices:■■■■■Take care if you collect personal data from third-party sources, including databaseresellers or if you get sales leads from customers or contacts.Take care if your organisation is a member of a group of companies and personal data istransferred between them.Non-commercial third-party sources require care too.Make sure the third-party source has consent from individuals concerned to disclose thepersonal data to you for the relevant purpose.Check that personal data collected from third-party sources is accurate.12There are some exceptions to the need for consent.But they usually do not apply to thethird-party source examples mentioned in this chapter.For example, in Canada and Singapore.24",,," What does an organisation collect personal data about an individual?

72,72,the customer care team,"Does your organisation invite retail purchasers of your products to send youtheir personal data so that you can register their products and validate themfor the warranties you offer on them?If so, the data protection law affects the way you collect, use anddisclose the personal data of these registered users/retail purchasers.Yourcustomer care team needs to take the data protection law into consideration.Warranty cardsDoes your organisation have warranty cards that require retail purchasers ofyour products to complete them and mail them to you to validate thewarranty?These are usually bundled with the organisation’s products so thatwhen the retailer sells the product the warranty card is inside the box orother packaging.Often these are warranty cards where the address of theorganisation is on one side and the retail purchaser completes the reverseside with their registration and purchase details.If so, beware.Requiring retail purchasers to send the warranty cards “as is” (with anarea for a postage stamp) might invite complaints to the regulator about afailure to comply with the data protection law.The reason is that the retailpurchaser’s details are fully exposed in the mail – they are disclosed toanyone who happens to see the warranty card when it is posted to yourorganisation.It is easy to argue that any retail purchaser who completes the warrantycard, adds a postage stamp to it and posts it implicitly consents to thedisclosure of their personal data in the postal system.But it is also easy toargue that a retail purchaser thought they had no choice but to do this if theywanted the benefit of the warranty and that your organisation should havebeen proactive in adopting alternative ways for them to register theirwarranty without unnecessarily disclosing their personal data.An electronic alternative to warranty cardsNow that most retail purchasers have access to the Internet manyorganisations provide a way for these purchasers to register their warrantiesonline.An organisation should consider providing an online registrationoption and encouraging retail purchasers to use it.However, care must betaken to ensure that no user information is publicly disclosed.In oneenforcement case, an organisation provided an online warranty registrationform via a third-party plug-in only to have it expose approximately 190 of itscustomers’ personal data.1Where your organisation provides a warranty card as an alternative toonline registration, it should instruct retail purchasers who choose not to usethe online system to return the warranty card in a sealed envelope.As anadditional customer service and encouragement to retail purchasers not to putunprotected information in the mail, your organisation could include a“postage paid” envelope with the warranty card where most of your retailsales are domestic.Recording personal data and other information in warranty cardsWhen an organisation has a warranty card, the retail purchaser completes itand mails it.The physical card arrives at the organisation’s mail box.Whathappens to the warranty card after the organisation receives it?Most likely,the information on the warranty card needs to be keyed into the organisation’scustomer relationship management system or otherwise digitised.If so,several important considerations then arise under the data protection law.Accuracy of personal dataDo the organisation’s employees key the information into the customerrelationship management system?If so, the organisation should haveprocesses and controls in place to make sure that the personal data in thewarranty card is complete and that it is keyed in accurately, which is arequirement under the data protection law.Selecting a vendor and entering into an agreement with the vendorInstead of employees keying information into its customer relationshipmanagement system, does the organisation outsource the data input to a third-party vendor?If so, does the organisation carry out due diligence to assureitself that the vendor is capable of complying with the data protection law?Does the organisation ensure that there is a written agreement betweenthe organisation and the vendor that clearly sets out the responsibilities,obligations and liabilities of the vendor so that the organisation has legalprotection to the extent possible in case of a failure by the vendor to complywith the data protection law?Protecting personal data in warranty cardsAre the warranty cards piled up somewhere until someone has time toprocess them in-house?Or are they piled up until there is a batch ready to besent to the third-party vendor for the data input to be done?The organisation has an obligation under the data protection law toprotect personal data in its possession.Therefore, in either case, theorganisation should ensure that the warranty cards are stored securely whileawaiting data input, such as being kept under lock and key.Access should berestricted to selected employees who have a need to handle the warrantycards for the purpose of doing their jobs.The organisation should also protect personal data collected in warrantycards after it has been recorded electronically.It must take reasonablesecurity arrangements and establish controls to protect it from unauthorisedaccess, collection, use, disclosure or similar risks.Retention of personal data in warranty cardsAfter the information in a warranty card is keyed into the organisation’scustomer relationship management system or digitised by its third-partyvendor, what happens to the hardcopy of the warranty cards?The obligation to protect the personal data in them continues.In addition,the data protection law does not permit an organisation to retain personaldata when it is no longer necessary for a legal or business purpose.Therefore the organisation should develop and implement a policy forsecurely disposing of the personal data in the hardcopy of the warranty cards.The organisation should also develop and implement a policy forsecurely deleting personal data collected in warranty cards from itselectronic records when it is no longer necessary for a legal or businesspurpose.Ongoing access to personal data collected in warranty cardsAfter information from warranty cards is keyed into the organisation’scustomer relationship management system or digitised by a third-party, whichemployees have access to it?For what purpose?The organisation shouldhave detailed policies and procedures setting out which employees haveaccess to the personal data and the purposes for which they are permitted touse or disclose it.Responding promptly to any customer inquiryIndividuals have a right under the data protection law to access to theirpersonal data in the possession of an organisation or under its control.2Manufacturers and distributors who provide product warranties canexpect retail purchasers to become more familiar with these rights over time.And they can expect individuals to test them by calling the organisation’scustomer service line to request access to their personal data and informationabout how the organisation has used it.There is a time limit within which organisations must respond to any suchrequest.It varies depending on the jurisdiction.An organisation should makesure that it understands the requirements applicable to it and that it trains itsemployees to respond properly to requests.Using personal data collected in warranty cards for marketing purposesWhere a retail purchaser completes a warranty card (or an online warrantyregistration) it is likely that they implicitly consent to the organisationcollecting, using and disclosing their personal data for the purpose ofregistering the warranty and meeting their product support commitmentsunder the warranty.If the organisation wants to use personal data in a warranty card orregistration for any other purpose – such as for marketing and promoting itsproducts – it must first obtain express consent from the retail purchaser.Anysuch express consent can be included in the warranty card or onlineregistration portal or the organisation could seek it at a later time.It shouldbe optional (so that the retail purchaser may obtain the benefit of thewarranty without agreeing that the organisation may use their personal datafor marketing and promotion purposes).And the organisation shouldestablish a process that enables it to respond whenever a retail purchaserwithdraws their consent to the organisation using their personal data formarketing and promotion purposes.Marketing and promotion purposes include contacting retail purchasersand sending them product advertising and promotional materials, includingwhere an existing product is reaching the end of its warranty period.It alsolikely includes aggregating the warranty cards submitted by any particularindividual to determine their purchase history and using data miningtechniques to target individuals the organisation has determined are likely tospend more on its products through, for example, up-selling to them andoffering them incentives to purchase more of the organisation’s products.Generally applicable to all organisations that collect personal data fromtheir customersWhatever kind of organisation you are in, as long as you collect, use ordisclose personal data of your customers, you have to comply with the dataprotection law.All the above processes that are applicable to organisationscollecting and processing personal data through warranty cards are equallyapplicable to your organisation, whether it is in the form of paper orelectronic documents.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations that collect personal data of their customers (for example, through warrantycards) should:■■■■■■■■Protect the personal data during transit.For example, warranty cards should not bemailed through the postal system without an envelope.Use a sealed envelope or providean electronic alternative.Have written policies and processes to ensure that the personal data is complete andrecorded accurately in the customer relationship management system (or some otherdatabase).Vet the third-party vendor hired to process personal data (for example, keying warrantycard information into an electronic system) to make sure that it is capable of complyingwith the data protection law.Have a written agreement with the vendor that clearly setsout rights, obligations and liabilities.Take reasonable steps to protect the personal data, whether it is in paper form (forexample, warranty cards) or when it is entered into an electronic database system.Devise and implement data retention policies in connection with both the hardcopy ofdocuments containing personal data (for example, in warranty cards) and the electronicversion.Have written policies and practices about access to personal data and the purposes forwhich it may be used or disclosed.All personnel should be trained in them.Be prepared to receive and respond to requests for access to personal data that yourorganisation holds.Respond to requests within the statutory time limit for doing so.Document these processes and train personnel in them.Make sure you do not use personal data collected for one purpose (for example, inwarranty cards) for any purpose for which you do not have implicit or express consent.125 Oct 2016, Breach of Protection Obligation by GMM Technoworld, PDPC

76,76,trouble,"If you own any properties – commercial or residential – and earn incomefrom them, the data protection law usually applies to you.It doesn’t matter ifyou do not feel that you are a “business organisation”.It doesn’t matter eitherwhether this is your only source of income or simply one of two or moresources of income.As a landlord you need personal data about your tenants to make adecision whether or not to rent the property to them and to enter into a leasewith them.There may be regulatory requirements for you to hold copies oftheir documents confirming their identity and their residency status.You mayhave a justifiable purpose for collecting and using confidential and evensensitive information about their background and profile.The data protection law governs the way you collect, use or disclose allsuch personal data.If you fail to comply with it, the regulator may takeenforcement action against you.Case study of a tenancy disputeA landlord and tenant got into a dispute over rent payments.The landlord’ssolicitor issued a demand letter to the tenant.But the demand letter was alsocopied to the tenant’s employer, thereby disclosing the fact of the dispute andthe amount of the rent in arrears.The tenant complained to the regulator1 on the basis that personal datarelating to the tenancy dispute is considered to be collected solely for thepurpose of dealing with or resolving the dispute between the tenant and thelandlord.Therefore, argued the tenant, it should be limited to the two parties.There was no reason why the tenant’s employer should be involved or eveninformed about the matter.The landlord failed to justify to the regulator why it was necessary towrite to the employer about the dispute.The regulator accepted that alandlord might wish to put pressure on a tenant to satisfy a demand for unpaidrent but found that such a use of the tenant’s personal data was not within theoriginal collection purpose.In fact, the regulator found that the landlorddisclosed the tenant’s personal information for a purpose that was differentfrom the purpose for which it was collected.The regulator required thelandlord to cease its practice of informing tenants’ employers about rentaldisputes.Lesson learnedAs a landlord you have personal data about your tenants that you collect andmay use as part of performing your tenancy agreement.That does not meanyou have the right to use or disclose it for other purposes, such ascomplaining to the tenants’ employer if there is a dispute.(Of course, sometimes an employer rents a property and an employeeoccupies it.In that case, and depending on the circumstances, a landlord maybe permitted by the data protection law to provide the employer with detailsof any dispute with the employee who is occupying the property.)Remember, tenants – like any individuals covered by the data protectionlaw – have the right to ask you how you have used or will be using ordisclosing their personal data collected by you as a landlord.Tips for landlordsIf you are considering using or disclosing personal data about your tenant,you must first consider whether the purpose of doing so is reasonablynecessary in order for you or the tenant to perform your respectiveobligations under the tenancy agreement.Err on the conservative side and seek the tenant’s consent to use ordisclose their personal data if a purpose is not clearly reasonably necessaryfor the performance of the tenancy agreement – even if the use or disclosureis with good intent.■Here is a laundry list:Specific circumstances may vary, but it is usually fine to disclose yourtenant’s contact details so that maintenance and repair works can be■■carried out – but check with the tenant about how they prefer to becontacted (such as by mobile phone, email, office phone).Do not pass your tenant’s contact details (or any other personal dataabout them) to anyone such as your insurance agent or a multi-levelmarketer.If you are unlucky enough to get a demanding or unreasonable tenant, donot disclose personal data about them, including on social media such asFacebook – remember that video clips, photos and digital gossip can alldisclose personal data.Protecting and retaining personal dataLandlords should be extremely careful when storing personal data abouttenants.It makes no difference whether the personal data is electronic or is inphysical documents.The data protection law requires you to take reasonable and practicalmeasures to protect any personal data in your possession or under yourcontrol.And that includes ensuring any folder containing your tenant’spersonal data is not lying around at home so that it is easily exposed to yourchildren or to friends or relatives visiting your home.Once it is no longer necessary for you to retain personal data about yourtenants for business or legal reasons, you should securely shred physicaldocuments or securely delete electronic records containing their personaldata.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIndividuals who are landlords renting out properties to tenants should handle the personaldata of the tenants with care by adopting the following practices:■■■■Ensure that personal data collected for the purpose of renting a property is used ordisclosed only for that purpose.Get consent from tenants before disclosing their personal data outside the context of thetenancy agreement.Ensure that the personal data and other confidential information about the tenants aresecurely kept or stored.Securely destroy or delete the tenants’ personal data when there is no business or legalreason to keep it.1Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, HK,

77,77,Signing visitors into your premises – what,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
78,78,does that do to your privacy programme?,"We all know that it’s very common for organisations to get every visitor totheir office to sign-in so that it has a record of them.What’s sometimes lessclear is why signing in is important – or even necessary for some sensiblereason.And what’s often overlooked is getting visitors to sign-in in a waythat is sensitive to their privacy.Building managers, including managementcompanies at condominiums, do the same thing.Let’s look at what these arrangements can do to your privacy programmeif the sign-in process isn’t thought through carefully.Why the privacy of visitors mattersCase study #1A multinational corporation based in Singapore had a sign-in book.Itrequired each visitor to write down their name, organisation, phone number,the person they were visiting and the purpose of the visit.Kevin signed in at10:30 a.m. He wrote that he was visiting David Lim for an interview.DavidLim was the local HR manager.William, a work colleague of Kevin’s, signed in at 3:00 p.m. Williamwas also there for a job interview with David Lim.While William wassigning in the receptionist took a phone call.William idly glanced through thesign in page for the day.William saw that Kevin had come in during themorning for an interview with David Lim.William concluded that he andKevin were competing for the same job.Now, if he’d been so inclined, William could have told his and Kevin’sboss that Kevin was being interviewed for another job.And he could havedropped subtle hints to David Lim about Kevin.Case study #2In another instance of recruitment, an internal candidate applied for anadvertised role.While pretending to have a friendly chat with thereceptionist, the internal candidate looked at the sign-in book each day tofind out who had come in to see the HR manager that day.The internal candidate noted down their names and then tried to figure outways to undermine them during the interview process.Case study #3A social club requires members to sign-in their guests.They need to writetheir name, their membership number, the guest’s name and the club facility(for example, the restaurant, bar or sporting facility) that they will be using.Imagine Mary Lee’s surprise one morning when she signed her friend infor tennis, but noticed that her husband had signed a woman in the previousevening for dinner in the restaurant.He’d told her that he had not toucheddown from Jakarta until around midnight.As these examples show, the privacy of visitors matters because it is notpossible to predict the damage that might be done where there is a breach oftheir privacy.In addition, after the sign-in process, the data protection law requiresorganisations to protect the personal data collected and not retain it forlonger than is reasonably necessary.An organisation needs to find a way to balance its legitimate need forsecurity at its business premises with the privacy interests of visitors.Does an organisation need to collect personal data from visitors?Sometimes an organisation needs to collect personal data from visitors.Butnot always.In case study #1, Kevin could simply have said to thereceptionist, “Hello.I’m Kevin and I’m here to see David Lim.He’sexpecting me at 10:30.”The receptionist would then let David Lim know hisvisitor had arrived.David Lim would come to the reception area to escortKevin to the meeting room or he would ask the receptionist to do so.There isno need to collect any personal data in a sign in book.In the case of individuals who register for a training or other event, whydoes the organisation need to confirm who has arrived and who has notarrived?Sometimes there are good reasons; sometimes there’s no apparentreason and it’s done as a matter of habit.I am always quite mystified about what an organisation achieves when Iam handed a couple of pages listing all delegates at an event and I am askedto initial or sign against my name to verify my attendance.I could pretend tobe anyone and initial against their name; anyone could pretend to be me andinitial against my name.And often I see the phone numbers and emailaddresses, and sometimes even the identity card numbers, of all other eventparticipants.The key is to think about what personal data, if any, needs to be collectedfrom visitors and for what purpose.We need to get out of a “just in case weneed it” or “this is what we always do” mentality.How to collect personal data from visitorsIf there is a need to collect personal data, there are several ways it can bedone that minimise any intrusion on privacy:■■■■■To keep a record of attendees at business meetings, the receptionist couldsimply ask each individual for their name card with their business contactinformation.To check off the arrival of individuals who have registered to attend atraining or other event, the receptionist could simply check them offagainst a list of registered participants or delegates, by putting a tick nextto their name so no one else sees the entire list.Where there is not a large number of visitors to the premises, thereceptionist could ask the individual for the information that theorganisation needs and write it down.The visitor will not see thepersonal data of earlier visitors.Where there is a large number of visitors to the premises who need to beidentified with certainty for some good reason, the organisation mightinvest in a barcode scanner and simply scan the identity cards of visitors.Where it is too burdensome for a receptionist to ask for personal data andwrite it down for each visitor, an organisation could ask each visitor tofill up a separate slip of paper with the necessary information.Or to enterit into an electronic device, such as an iPad.In any case, the organisationshould ensure that other individuals cannot look over the visitor’sshoulder and see the personal data.The key here is to figure out what works best for the organisation from apractical perspective while also protecting the privacy of visitors.We needto get out of an “everyone else does it this way” mentality too.Even if it istrue that “everyone else does it this way”, that does not make it right.And itdoes not mean that their privacy is not important or should not be protected.Protection and retention of personal dataAn organisation is obliged to protect personal data in its possession or underits control.It is permitted to retain personal data only for so long as it isnecessary for a legal or business purpose.But what typically happens to sign-in books?Whenever a new book isstarted, the old book goes into some cupboard or drawer.It’s out of sight andout of mind, and often not secured under lock and key.It is kept, if notforever, then until the organisation does a clean up, such as when it nextmoves premises or does some spring cleaning for some other reason.The same applies when an organisation uses sign-in slips or capturespersonal data electronically or keeps registration or other lists.■■■The key here is for an organisation to:decide how long it needs to retain personal data in its sign-in records,which is of course very closely related to the reason for collecting thatpersonal datadevise and implement a retention policy that ensures the sign in recordsaren’t retained for longer than necessary andensure that the sign in records are protected from loss or theft for the timethat the organisation does need to retain the personal data in them – andthat they are protected from the idle gaze of employees who have no needto see them (as in case study #2) or from other visitors (as in case studies#1 and #3).CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations that have a process for signing in visitors to their premises should adopt thefollowing practices:■■Make sure that you have a reasonable purpose for collecting and retaining the records ofvisitors.Do not collect more personal data than is reasonably necessary for the relevantpurpose.■■■Consider collecting less sensitive personal data if the purpose is served (for example, anoffice telephone number rather than an identity card number).Ensure that the visitors’ records are adequately protected.Have a data retention policy for your visitors’ records and carry out regular audits toensure compliance with it.SECTION C:",,," Why is signing in important?

79,79,Anonymising personal data – but is the,"individual really not identifiable?At an unidentified beach resort somewhere, two friends are lazing by thebeach and debating the affairs of the world.The conversation soon turnsto the concept of anonymity…A: Why do people want to be anonymous?B: So that others will not know their true identities.A: Whatever for?B: So they can hide under a cloak of secrecy to say and do things that societyor the government might not approve of them saying or doing.A: Such as?B: You may have heard of the “Anonymous” group of “hacktivists” whohack into government, religious and corporate websites, defacing them orposting vitriolic anti-establishment or protest content.By doing so, theyhope to expose cover-ups, scandals or corruption in government andcorporations in the name of justice or in their fight for the rights of thedisadvantaged.None of the members of the “Anonymous” group everuses any name.If they appear in public, such as when they make a publicstatement about their position on some issue, they wear a mask so thatthey can’t be identified.Or you may have read comments posted by individuals on socialmedia platforms using a pseudonym – a fictitious name or an alias, forexample – rather than their real names.They feel more liberated to airtheir views freely without fear of being tracked down by the authorities,lobby groups or other people who oppose their views.A: Are you saying that being anonymous is different from using apseudonym?B: Yes.When an individual is anonymous they can’t be identified by name.So if they do two or more different things there’s no way of knowing thatthe same individual did them.When someone uses a pseudonym they are using a false name.Theystill can’t be identified by name.But if the same person does two or moredifferent things under the same pseudonym it’s known that the sameindividual did those things.A: So, using a pseudonym is, strictly speaking, not anonymity butpseudonymity.But they are both ways in which an individual can hidetheir identity.B: You are absolutely right.If I were to place the two concepts on a scale, Iwould say that pseudonymity is less strong in concealing the true identityof an individual as compared to anonymity.A: So far, you have cited examples of the negative side of anonymity.Arethere positive examples too?B: Plenty.Say a rich person wants to donate a large sum of money to acertain charity.They don’t want their true identity to be known in casethere is publicity.It may infringe on their personal privacy, for example,because they are suddenly newsworthy and stories are written withdetails about their life or because they receive a spate of letters andphone calls seeking donations.Or simply because other people, includingtheir friends, congratulate them about their generosity when they wouldprefer not to talk about their donation.So they donate the moneyanonymously, so that not even the recipient charity knows their identity.In research, there are many instances where the researcheranonymises the raw data of the sampled individuals so that they becomenon-identifiable.This is intended to ensure that sensitive personal data ofindividuals, such as health and medical data, are not disclosed.After all,in most research studies, the researcher is interested in trends, patternsand profiles derived from aggregated data.The identity of the individualsin the research sample doesn’t matter.A: If, as you say, researchers are interested in aggregated data only, thenwhy don’t they just leave out the unique identifiers of the individuals,such as their full name, home address and identity card number when theycollect the personal data?B: Ah, that’s a good question.And the answer depends at least partly on thetype of research and also on whether the personal data was collectedsolely for the research or whether it was collected for some otherpurposes and then later used for research.For most research projects the researcher needs to have some uniqueidentifiers of the individuals surveyed for two reasons.First, for theresearch to be accepted as valid the researcher may for practical reasonsneed to be able to verify that the data comes from real people.Secondly,when researchers are analysing and compiling their survey results theymay need to clarify with the individuals concerned any ambiguity ordiscrepancy in their survey responses.For some research projects the researcher doesn’t need to have anyunique identifiers for the individuals surveyed.This happens most oftenwhen the research is merely observational.For example, in a survey ofpublic transport usage the researcher may simply need to observe andcount the number of individuals, divided into categories of men, womenand children, boarding certain buses and trains at specific times of theday and night.A: OK.That’s interesting.What did you mean when you mentioned that anorganisation might collect personal data for a particular purpose and thenlater use it for research?B: Well, say for example, that a voluntary welfare organisation, a charity,provides counselling and support in connection with an addiction, suchas gambling addiction.For that purpose, it collects a wide range ofpersonal data from individuals about themselves and their families andfamily circumstances.Under the data protection law, the organisation must dispose of thispersonal data when it is no longer necessary for a legal or businesspurpose.Or the organisation may anonymise it and then can continue tokeep it.The organisation might want to use it for research purposes or forsimilar purposes such as planning future service delivery or assessing theeffectiveness of the organisation’s counselling services.To anonymise it effectively, the organisation must remove anddispose of all the personal data that might identify an individual and thenit may keep the remainder.The organisation might assign a uniqueidentifier to individuals for convenience when it refers to them.But forthe data to be anonymised for the purposes of the data protection law theorganisation must not keep the “key” to re-identifying any individuals.A: You’ve lost me.What do you mean?B: Well, John Lim of such and such address may be identified as “Man #1”and David Lee of some other address may be identified as “Man #2” andso on.Imagine a spreadsheet with the real names and addresses in twocolumns and “Man #1”, “Man #2” in another column.To anonymise thispersonal data, the organisation must get rid of the two columns of namesand addresses, retaining no copy, so that it is not possible to work out theidentity of “Man #1”, “Man #2”, etc.And this is just a fairly simple example that I’ve given.Depending onthe circumstances, there may be more personal data that will need to betaken away so that re-identification is not possible, such as theindividual’s mobile phone number and their identity card number.Thiscan all be really tricky.I’m just giving you an idea of the way it works.To avoid unpleasant surprises, such as not complying with the dataprotection law, anonymisation of personal data collected for a specificpurpose usually needs some expert assistance.A: Right.I get it.But how can one be sure that once the data is anonymised,there is no means to re-identify it and link it back to the originalindividuals?B: Well, most research organisations are governed by strict policies andcodes of practice.These require them to remove the unique identifiersfrom the datasets once the research study is completed.They have toovercome any “just in case” thoughts of researchers who want to keep theunique identifiers just in case they might need them in the future.And of course there is also the data protection law.If an individualfinds out that an organisation has kept the means of identifying them forlonger than the organisation needs their personal data for business orlegal purposes they can complain to the regulator.The penalties for anorganisation failing to comply with the data protection law can be stiff.A: So much for research organisations.As an individual, how can I be surethat my anonymity is protected if I choose to be anonymous on certainoccasions or under certain circumstances?For example, what if I want toremain anonymous when I contribute to an online forum that is discussingcontroversial and sensitive issues?B: Well, usually you need to use some identifier on online forums, so you’lluse a false name or alias that you think doesn’t identify you.It’ll be acase of pseudonymity, rather than anonymity.Unfortunately, even if you can’t be identified by your pseudonym it isimpossible to be absolutely sure that your personal identity will never befound out, especially in today’s highly connected and networked world.This is because your mobile devices and other gadgets are suregiveaways of your location.What I’m talking about here are mobile phone networks that canpinpoint your location through the signals emitting from your mobilephone.If you use public WiFi networks they also keep track of yourlocation.Then there is the GPS (Global Positioning System) function inyour phone or tablet.Some devices and gadgets (such as payment cards)use NFC (Near Field Communication) or RFID (Radio FrequencyIdentification).If any of these methods show that you are usually in the same locationfrom, say, 10:00 p.m. every day to 7:30 a.m. the following day, yourhome address is known.Ah, you say, but it’s a condo so no one can knowwhich of several individuals is me.Easy.Someone who wanted moreinformation could sit outside the condo and wait until they see yourmobile phone moving.Then they’ll have you car registration number.They could follow you to your office and then know where you work.They could come into your office and ask the receptionist for your nameor they could find it out through car registration records.A: This is getting scary.Maybe I should be careful and turn off the location-identifying functions on my devices where possible and get rid of thosedevices and gadgets where I can’t turn it off.B: That sounds pretty inconvenient to me.And it won’t necessarily keepyour identity hidden.This is because when you surf the Internet, visitwebsites, communicate via emails or do online shopping, you leavebehind loads of digital trails like your IP address, cookies downloadedon your computer, and the websites you have visited.Service providers can use this information to match against theirdatabases to identify you easily.I recall a police investigation wheretelephone companies – mobile phone carriers – were ordered by theCourt to reveal the identities of a suspected group of drug traffickers whoused their mobile phones to communicate with one another.And inseveral countries in 2015 the Courts ordered Internet Service Providers(ISPs) to reveal the identities of individuals who had allegedlydownloaded illegal copies of a movie called Dallas Buyers Club.In a publication of the International Association of PrivacyProfessionals (IAPP) it was reported that knowing just three pieces ofinformation about an individual – namely the birth date, zip/post codeand gender – can identify the individual with a high degree of certainty bymatching them against public records.A: Wow, that’s scary!We can’t go around ignorantly thinking that anonymityor pseudonymity will protect us from being identified.We have to bevery careful in what we say or do from now on.Hey, why don’t we blogabout what we have discussed today, to share with a larger audience?Should we do it anonymously, pseudonymously or with our trueidentities?B: Haha!That depends on the content and the audience.The two friends then enjoy the beautiful sunset, while sipping the exoticfruit punch.Another fruitful day!CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and individuals should be aware of how to deal with anonymised data:■■■Personally identifiable information can be anonymised by removing the unique identifiers,through aggregation or generalisation, or by replacing the actual data values with othervalues.Do not assume that anonymity is safe.People can be re-identified through a few piecesof information about them and matched against public records.The Internet and portable smart devices make it easier to track the location and usagepatterns of individuals, and service providers can link these back to their databases forre-identification.29",,," Where are two friends lazing by thebeach and debating the affairs of the world?

82,82,passed in your organisation?,"One of my favourite track and field events in athletics is the 4x100 metrerelay.It’s always a beautiful sight to behold as teams of four runners raceround the 400-metre track, each sprinting like a gazelle for 100 metres beforethe next runner in line takes over.What is more amazing to watch is the slick coordination and precisionwith which each runner passes the baton to the succeeding runner.The“passer” waits for the right moment to release the baton.The “receiver”waits for the right moment to grasp it tightly and securely before taking offfor the next leg of the race.How I wish personal data and other confidential information could bepassed between employees within organisations with the same slickness –without dropping the “information baton”. (“Information” here refers to bothpersonal data and other confidential information.)In our consulting work, one of the most common shortcomings we see inorganisations is the lack of proper processes for employees, particularly indifferent departments, handing/taking over documents containing personaldata or other confidential information.More often than not, the “passer” ofthe information baton does not check to make sure that the “receiver” has gotit securely in their grasp.In other words, the organisation does not have a policy and documentedpractice for the “passer” to get an acknowledgement from the “receiver” thatthey have received the personal data or other confidential information.Thecommon mindset is: “I’ve already done my part.It is up to the other person inthe downstream process to take over from there.”But what if the personal data or other confidential data gets lost,misplaced or delivered wrongly along the way?An organisation shouldensure that it complies with the data protection law whenever the informationbaton includes personal data.And of course for sensible business reasons anorganisation certainly does not want to lose, misplace or deliver wrongly anyconfidential information, even if does not include any personal data.Here are some tips for passing information batons within an organisationsecurely.Type A baton: Documents moving within a department or work groupPersonal data and other confidential information may be in hardcopy formand need to be passed between individuals in the same department or workgroup.Their desks are usually close to one another.This is easy.Individuals simply hand hardcopy documents to others in thedepartment or work group.There is face-to-face interaction between the“passer” and the “receiver”, so the information baton is passed securely tothe right person.When the “receiver” is not at their desk, the “passer” can either deliverthe document later or leave a note on the “receiver’s” desk to have themcollect the document from the “passer”.Type B baton: Documents moving from one department or work group toanother department or work groupPersonal data and other confidential information may be in hardcopy andneed to be passed from one department or work group to another.Their desksare often not close to one another.Often, an inter-departmental “mail run” isused.Sometimes an organisation maintains a system where employees eachhave a secure “pigeonhole” for exchanging documents and other items.In any event, organisations should have policies and documentedpractices in place about confidential documents in hardcopy that are nothand-delivered by the “passer” to the “receiver”.The policies and practices should require employees to put confidentialdocuments into a sealed envelope with “Confidential” stamped on both sidesof it.Employees should also make sure that:■ they do not use one of those brown envelopes that are designed for reuse– tying the string around the stud does not make it into a sealed envelope;and putting a piece of sticky tape across the flap (which gets done a lot oftimes during the “life” of these envelopes) does not make it into a sealedenvelope either■if personal data or other confidential information can be read through theenvelope, they should use a thicker envelope or insert an additional sheetof paper to shield the information.Of course, the front of the envelope should also have the name of theaddressee and will sometimes show their department’s name and even theiroffice location.This is because appropriate steps should be taken from botha data protection perspective and a business perspective to ensure that theenvelope is not lost, misplaced or wrongly delivered.Or not delivered at alland, perhaps, simply thrown into a rubbish bin by employees who do notknow where and how to deliver it.The policies and practices should also require the “passer” to put apacking list in the envelope listing the documents in it.This is for the“receiver” to verify the number and type of documents in it.The “passer”should also be required to put an acknowledgement slip in the envelope forthe “receiver” to sign and return to the “passer”.And of course the policies and practices should require the “passer” tomake sure that they receive the acknowledgement slip and file itappropriately.This is so that it can be retrieved readily if there are anyqueries in the future about the way in which the relevant personal data washandled within the organisation.Type C baton: Documents moving outside the organisationPersonal data and other confidential information may be in hardcopy formand need to be passed to a “receiver” who is outside the organisation, but inthe same country.It could be another entity within the same group ofcompanies.It could be a vendor retained to process the personal data insome way.Or it could be some other separate organisation to which thepersonal data may be disclosed legitimately.In some cases, the “receiver” is an entity within the same customer groupor the organisation has a close relationship with frequent interaction with the“receiver”.Passing the personal data or other confidential information fromthe “passer” to the “receiver” might, in practice, be done in exactly the sameway as when it moves between departments and work groups within the sameorganisation.Otherwise, documents containing personal data or other confidentialinformation will likely be passed by the “passer” to the “receiver” by acourier service or the national postal service.Either mode of deliveryservice should include registration, on-route tracking and acknowledgementof receipt of the package by the rightful “receiver”.If using a courier service, the organisation should carry out appropriatedue diligence to satisfy itself that it selects a reputable and reliable courierservice that will guarantee a safe and secure delivery of the confidentialdocuments from the “passer” to the “receiver”.If using a national postalservice, the organisation should consider whether doing so is appropriateversus engaging a courier service, particularly where the personal data orother confidential information is sensitive and/or the postal system might notbe particularly secure and/or reliable.In either case, policies and practices adopted by the organisation shouldrequire employees to mark the envelope and/or courier package as“Confidential”.Personal data or other confidential information should be putinto an inner envelope that is placed inside the outer envelope that will bemailed or inside the courier package.The inner envelope should beaddressed to a specific named individual.It should be marked “To be openedonly by <name of that specific person>”.After all, there is little point ingoing to the trouble of protecting personal data or other confidentialinformation in transit only to have it opened by any virtually unidentifiableindividual whose job it is to open all incoming mail at the “receiver”organisation.Of course, the “passer” should be required to take care in specifying thename and address of the “receiver” completely and accurately.The policiesand practices should also require the packing list and acknowledgementdescribed above, at least where the personal data or other confidentialinformation is sensitive for some reason.And require the “passer” to makesure that they receive the acknowledgement slip and file it appropriately.Type D baton: Documents moving outside the countryPersonal data and other confidential information may be in hardcopy formand need to be passed to a “receiver” in another country.The considerationsset out above for documents moving to another organisation in the samecountry apply.In addition, whenever the information “baton” includes personal data the“passer” is required to satisfy any requirements of the data protection lawrelating to transfer of personal data outside of the country.These are oftencomplicated – too complicated and varied to be described here – andsometimes include specific rules about consent for transfer of personal dataoutside the country.For example, the “passer” organisation might be required to ensure thatthe “receiver” is located in a country where the laws governing personal dataprotection are of a standard that is comparable to that of their country’s laws.Or, the “passer” organisation might have to get the “receiver” organisation tosign a legally binding agreement to take specific steps to protect the personaldata.Is the administrative burden too heavy?It may seem that the above processes and practices introduce inconvenientand perhaps inefficient administrative burdens to organisations.But in general circumstances, these are necessary to give a reasonableassurance of compliance with the data protection law.In specificcircumstances, an organisation may need to do even more to supportcompliance with the data protection law, such as where the organisation ishandling highly sensitive personal data.As the old adage says, “It’s better tobe safe than sorry”.When any confidential document containing organisation-criticalinformation (such as personal data, commercially sensitive information orintellectual property) goes missing, is misplaced or is delivered to the wrongparty, it may bring about grave damage to the organisation.If it becomesknown publicly, it can undermine stakeholders’ trust in the organisation too.An after-note on information in the electronic domainThe passing of the information “baton” in the electronic domain poses aneven higher risk than in the case of hardcopy documents.This is because thetransmission of confidential emails or e-file attachments transcends anyorganisational or geographical boundary.A proper handing-over and taking-over procedure is even more necessary in the electronic domain.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should have documented policies and practices for passing personal dataand other confidential information internally and externally.Passing Type A information baton■ Hand over confidential documents personally.Passing Type B information baton■■Use inter-departmental mail run or place confidential document in the individual’s securepigeonhole.Put document together with packing list and acknowledgement slip in sealed envelopesstamped “Confidential”.Passing Type C information baton■ Use a reliable courier service or the national postal service with procedures forregistration, on-route tracking and acknowledgement of receipt.Passing Type D information baton■■Ensure the recipient’s country has a comparable data protection law as the sender’scountry.Otherwise, get the recipient to sign a contract that requires the recipient to safeguard thetransferred information.31",,," What is one of my favourite track and field events in athletics?

84,84,and duplication,"When we were kids our parents used to drum into us the need to share ourtoys and goodies with our siblings, and also with our cousins when theycame to visit.We grew up with the acceptable norm that “sharing is good”.This sharing behaviour carried on during our first few years in school.But when we progressed on to upper primary school and beyond we becamemore selfish with our sharing.We became wary about sharing what we knewwith our classmates, due to competition in examinations.Then when we started our working life we were cautioned not to sharetoo much about what we were doing, such as the organisation’s vision andstrategies, and details of our projects, due to external competition and evenindustrial espionage.Many organisations, especially those handling highly confidential andsensitive information, are paranoid about safeguarding their proprietaryinformation because leakage may result in significant adverse businessoutcomes.In addition, where confidential information is personal data,organisations should ensure that they comply with the data protection law.Ifthey fail to do so the regulator may require them to comply with its directionsor may fine them.Regulatory action is generally likely to bring with it a riskof adverse publicity and a consequent lack of trust, giving rise to anotheradverse business outcome.With the ubiquity and accessibility of affordable photocopiers, scannersand digital cameras, how can organisations prevent their employees – eitherdisgruntled and unscrupulous or simply lazy and careless – from makingunauthorised copies of confidential paper documents, including cases whereit contains personal data?Below we offer a few practical tips which organisations can adopt tominimise their employees getting access to confidential documents, includingdocuments containing personal data, and making unauthorised copies of suchdocuments.Getting the “structure” right firstFirst and foremost, it is important to note that an organisation should adoptpolicies and documented practices about how their employees may and maynot handle confidential paper documents.In any information security regime, the human being is often the weakestlink in the entire chain.That is why clearly spelt out policies, rules,processes and procedures for handling and duplicating confidentialdocuments are of great importance.Everyone in the organisation must “playby the rules” – they can do so only if they know what they may do and whatthey must not do.Employment contracts and/or employee handbooks should requireemployees to comply with theses policies and practices.There should bedisciplinary consequences for failure to do so, including warnings andtraining, up to and including dismissal.Access to documentsThe organisation’s policies and practices should cover access by theiremployees to confidential paper documents.This will cover points such as who – defined by job role or title – canhave access to what type(s) of information.Defining permissions by job titlemeans that it may remain stable over time, though the organisation shouldreview them regularly to ensure that they remain relevant.After all, job rolesdo evolve over time and requirements for access to confidential informationmay change.If an organisation chooses to define right-of-access by reference tonamed individuals (instead of being defined by job roles or titles), theorganisation should review their permission whenever the individual’s jobrole changes.Transferring documentsThe organisation’s policies and practices should cover the processes andprocedures for transferring confidential paper documents internally withinthe organisation and to third-parties outside the organisation.The individual handing confidential documents over to another individualis usually responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of the information,including personal data, included in the document.However, theresponsibility should be documented clearly so that employees understand it.It is too late after something has gone wrong for employees to say, quitegenuinely, “But I didn’t know that I was supposed to…”.Copying and sharing documentsThe organisation’s policies and practices should cover when employees maymake copies of a confidential document or of personal data and when theymay share it with other employees within the organisation.Sometimes thismay include a requirement for employees handing a document over to othercolleagues to remind them that they must not make copies of the document orto share it with anyone else.And it may include retrieving copies ofdocuments after they have served their purpose.In some organisations, for example, employees in the Human Resource(HR) Department make enough copies of a potential employee’s jobapplication form and résumé so that there is one copy for each member of theinterview panel.The copies are put into sealed envelopes and sent to theintended recipients through the organisation’s internal mail system.At the endof the job interview, the HR employees retrieve all copies of the documentsthat they sent to the members of the interview panel and seek assurance thatthe panel members did not make any copies of them.Permission for copying documentsThe organisation’s policies and practices should not permit its employees tomake copies of confidential documents without the explicit permission of thedocuments’ originator (or of some other specified individual).Using copiers and scannersThe organisation’s policies and practices should state that only staff withlegitimate staff access passes may use the organisation’s photocopiers andscanners.Preferably, use should be controlled and tracked by requiringemployees to input access codes which are assigned to them and which theyare not permitted to share with other employees.These codes should, in anyevent, be changed by the organisation periodically.Records of usage of photocopiers and scanners should be reviewed byemployees to whom that responsibility is assigned.They should askemployees to account for any usage that seems unusual or inappropriate giventheir job role.CCTV monitoringThe organisation should consider whether, as an additional safeguard, CCTVcameras should be installed at strategic locations within their office to deterany malicious insider from stealing or taking digital images of confidentialdocuments. (Of course, access to the office should be controlled so that anyoutsiders cannot enter and steal or take digital images of confidentialdocuments.)CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESTo control the unauthorised duplication of paper documents containing personal data andother confidential information, organisations should put in place the following measures:■■■■■Explicit policies and rules on how confidential paper documents are to be handled byemployees within the organisation.Processes and procedures on how confidential paper documents are to be transferredfrom one party to the next.All employees should be briefed to not make copies of confidential documents withoutthe explicit permission of the documents’ originator.Only employees with legitimate staff access passes can make use of the organisation’sphotocopiers and scanners using access codes.As an additional safeguard, CCTV cameras can be installed at strategic locations todeter any malicious insider from stealing or taking digital images of confidentialdocuments.32",,," When did parents drum into us?

sometimes it will be put into arecycling tray for internal use.It is common for organisations to place arecycling tray next to the printer or photocopier, for example, so that thereverse side of any unused printed pages or copies can be used.Butemployees fail to notice that the paper may have personal data on the sidethat has been printed on.While saving the environment is an important initiative, protectingpersonal data is a legal obligation under the data protection law.There areother ways of reducing paper usage while not exposing the organisation todata protection compliance risks.For example, the printer or copier can be set to “duplex” mode so that italways prints or copies on both sides of the paper when a document is morethan one page long.And documents can be printed, say, two pages on eachside, which is often perfectly workable for checking and reviewing draftdocuments.Dispose of unwanted documents containing personal data securelyYou should always shred any document that includes personal data.Or get itshredded for you by an appropriate vendor.Never throw any document that includes personal data into thewastepaper basket.Never throw it into a recycle bin that gets taken away byanother organisation unless you have done appropriate due diligence andconfirmed that the other organisation will, in fact, shred it securely. (Did youknow that some so-called paper recycling organisations that say they shredpaper and then recycle it actually sell at least some of it?And that it ends upbeing used in all sorts of ways where personal data may be exposed?)When you print documents that include personal data or photocopy them,make sure that you do not leave discarded or imperfect prints behind at theprinter or copier for whatever reason, including so that the paper can berecycled internally.Beware when you move houseWe see that individuals who are constantly on the move as part of their job –for example, where they are sales agents and other independent contractors –end up with files and documents stored at home.If that describes you,beware when you move house.People tend to get careless when getting rid of old stuff – they throw itinto a bin or get someone to take it away and don’t care what happens to it.But the old stuff that you get rid of so carelessly could happen to be your oldtransaction records containing other people’s personal data.You shouldalways shred it or get it shredded for you by an appropriate vendor.Beware when submitting or archiving personal informationWhether you are in a hurry to meet a submission deadline or handing overdocuments to another person, your should take steps to put proper securitymeasures in place.Never leave a document containing personal data on someone’s desk oreven in an exposed tray for incoming documents.You never know who mightwalk past and see it.They may be other employees, but that does not meanthat they are authorised to see it.At least put the personal data in a sealedenvelope marked to the attention of the individual you want to receive it.If you have to submit documents to your agency or company and themedium for doing so is not secure, inform their management that the dataprotection law requires organisations to take reasonable measures to protectpersonal data in their possession or under their control.The submission boxshould be secure and it should not be possible for unauthorised employees toretrieve documents.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and individuals handling documents containing personal data or otherconfidential information should do the following:■■■■Ensure that all physical files and folders containing personal data are clearly marked as“Confidential”.Put in place policies and practices that require any files or bags containing personaldata, particularly where it is sensitive, to be secured so that the personal data is notdisclosed when the files or bags are in transit or taken into meetings.Ensure that no personal data is exposed due to any paper recycling and that documentsare disposed of securely, such as by secure shredding.If you are constantly on the move as part of your job, do not dispose of personal datacarelessly, leave it exposed when delivered to someone else or submit it to anorganisation in an insecure manner.33",,," Why did the regulator prosecute individuals and organisations?

89,89,copier,"How much do you know about photocopiers or what are known as multi-functional devices?Here’s something I learned that is very important fromthe perspective of operational compliance with the data protection law.These machines used to use a process called analogue copying.Aninternal mirror copied the image of a document onto a drum and then, usingstatic electricity, particles of toner created the image that was on the drum.Then around 2002, digital copiers came onto the market.At first they wereexpensive compared with analogue copiers, but of course technology gotcheaper and so did digital copiers.A digital copier scans a document andsaves it into its memory – it contains a hard disk – and then a laser is used toprint the saved image.The copier has since evolved into a multi-functional device (MFD),providing centralised document management, distribution and productionwithin an office setting.Besides the photocopy function, a typical MFD nowacts as a combination of some or all of the following devices: email, fax,printer and scanner.Recently, I mentioned this to a colleague, who replied by saying that onlyvery high-end copiers are digital.Alas, they were mistaken.Digital copiersare ubiquitous.That means that nearly every copier now contains a hard disk– similar to your personal computer – capable of storing images of everydocument copied, scanned, or emailed by the machine.And most of us do notknow about it.Some field investigationsA few years back, CBS News chief investigative correspondent ArmenKeteyian went to a warehouse in the state of New Jersey to see how hard itwould be to buy a used photocopier loaded with documents.What he foundwas “a digital time-bomb packed with highly-personal or sensitive data suchas social security numbers, birth certificates, bank records, income taxforms”.It would be a gold mine for anyone in the identity theft business.No wonder the US Department of Health and Human Services finedAffinity Health Plan Inc US$1.2m in 2013 for violating the HIPAA Privacyand Security Rules when it failed to wipe data from the hard disks when itreturned its leased copiers to the leasing company.General lessons learned about digital copiersNow that you know about copier technology, you know that every time youcopy, print, scan or fax a document using a digital copier – whether you do itusing your office’s multi-functional printer or a separate device – a digitalcopy of your document is stored in that hard disk, including any personal datain that document.So, therefore, an organisation should securely delete personal data fromthe hard desk in its copier before parting with possession of the copier.Otherwise you likely do not comply with the requirement of the dataprotection law to protect personal data in the organisation’s possession orunder its control.An additional lesson for mobile workersIf you are a mobile worker – a salesperson, agent or adviser, for example –do you sometimes need to use a copier in a client’s office or in a hotelbusiness centre or in some other public or semi-public place?If so, you nowknow that the copier will more likely than not be a digital copier and that itwill retain a copy of your document, including any personal data, on its harddisk.This involves at least two risks.First, there may be an unauthoriseddisclosure of personal data to anyone who examines the hard disk in thecopier and therefore a failure to comply with the data protection law.Second, anyone who examines the hard disk will have access to anyconfidential information that was in the copied document, information thatcould be incredibly valuable to a competitor of your organisation.Other operational failures to protect personal data at the copierIn our onsite audits for our clients we have found the following commoncopier operational failures to protect personal data.These are in addition tocopies of documents containing personal data being found on the hard disksof digital copiers.■■■■■Uncollected printouts left in the printer or photocopierOriginal documents left under the scanner or printer coverUnwanted prints (with personal data) thrown in the wastepaper basketRecycled paper used for printouts with personal data already printed onitUnsecured photocopiers with email and recall featuresSuch careless actions or negligence could put your customers, employees,clients or students at risk due to ineffective or non-existent security practiceson your part or your organisation’s part relating to your photocopiers andother multi-function peripherals.Tips for procurement and office administrationIn addition to the operational tips above, employees responsible forprocurement should include at least the following safeguards to help ensurethe safety of data on the hard disk of a digital copier:■■■■the lease or purchase contract should include a requirement for it to beencrypted and for it to use overwrite protection techniquesthe lease contract should also specify a disposal process for the copierthat requires the lessor to remove the hard disk (and return it to the lesseeorganisation for destruction) when the lease comes to an endinternal policies should be implemented to ensure that a purchased copieris not sold to a third-party without the hard disk first being removed (andretained by the organisation for destruction) andinternal policies should set out requirements for secure deletion of datafrom hard disks removed from digital copiers or for their securedestruction.Employee trainingIt goes without saying that another important step you should take is to ensurethat your security training and educational materials for employees alsocover the potential for data leakage from multifunctional photocopiers andprinters.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and individuals who make use of digital copiers should take the followingprecautionary measures:■■■■■Understand that digital copiers (and printers) contain a hard disk and ensure that it isremoved or that all data is securely deleted from it before your organisation parts withpossession of the device.If you are a mobile worker, you should not use copiers at your client’s premises or anycopier available for use by the public generally.You should make copies of documentsonly at your own office.Ensure that personnel are not careless about leaving personal data exposed in, on oraround the office copier.Discarded copies must be securely shredded.Ensure that the necessary due diligence with the copier vendor or lessor is in place froma

90,90,Using personal data from unclear or,"unauthorised sourcesMarketers live and die on lists – hundreds and thousands of names andcontact information of prospects, referrals, ex-customers and currentcustomers.If they can get additional profile information of these individuals,marketers segment their lists into sub-groups so they can do more specific,targeted marketing.Today, companies in the business of selling lists to marketers might seemto make marketers’ dreams come true.Marketers like the idea that they canuse the ready-made lists to find and contact potential customers withoutdoing the tedious and laborious task of “harvesting” and compiling the liststhemselves.But little do these “quick-fix” marketers know – or they know and chooseto ignore it – that some of the lists they purchase come from dubious orunauthorised sources that fail to comply with the data protection law.Some common ways of failing to comply with the data protection lawHere are some common examples of failure to comply with the dataprotection law we have seen in our consulting work:■■■■Personal data of individuals who have not given relevant consent for thecollection, use and disclosure of their personal dataPersonal data of individuals who have given consent for the collection,use and disclosure of their personal data for a specific purpose (forexample, participation in a lucky draw) but not for marketing or otherpurposesPersonal data of individuals who have withdrawn consent to theirpersonal data being used for marketing purposesPersonal data that is inaccurate or outdated■■Personal data that includes phone numbers on the national Do-Not-Call(DNC) registryPublicly available information collected from government departmentsand public agencies and sold despite specific terms of use that mightinclude a ban on selling the personal data and/or restrict the purposes forwhich the data can be usedObviously, marketers should purchase ready-made lists with their eyes opento avoid failing to comply with the data protection law.Tips about how marketers can protect their organisationWhenever they consider purchasing a ready-made list, marketers shouldconduct appropriate due diligence to satisfy themselves that none of thenames on the list suffers from any problems such as those listed above.Theyshould get written evidence from the seller and keep it on file.This mightinclude, for example, getting the seller to produce evidence of consent andany other necessary permissions relevant to the marketer purchasing thepersonal data and using or disclosing it for marketing purposes.Generally, the evidence provided by the seller that is least open to legalchallenge about its validity is the written contract between the seller and themarketer.It should include representations and warranties by the seller aboutcompliance with the data protection law.While notoriously difficult to negotiate, marketers should require theseller to provide an indemnity to their organisation to cover damages, costsand losses resulting from any failure by the seller to comply with the dataprotection law.These measures will likely not protect the marketer fromregulatory action for any failure to comply with the data protection law bypurchasing and using the list, but may go some way towards mitigatingculpability in the regulator’s eyes.The biggest “red flag”In practice, most list sellers will not provide the various assurancesmentioned above.Either they cannot do so because there are problems of thetypes listed above – they do not have evidence of consent, for example – orthere is some other unknown factor in play.Either case is a big “red flag” formarketers and their organisation.In any case, getting the suggested assurances takes a lot of time.From theperspective of both regulatory risk and time, it pays for marketers to“harvest” and compile their own lists through their own effort and incompliance with the data protection law.Then they can have sweet dreamsinstead of nightmares.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESBefore marketers make use of ready-made contact lists from third-party sources, theyshould check that the following have not been contravened:■■■■■Personal data of individuals where consent for collection, use and disclosure has not beobtained.Personal data of individuals where consent for collection, use and disclosure has beenobtained for a specific purpose, but is now being used for a different purpose.Personal data of individuals who have withdrawn their consent.Personal phone numbers that have been registered with the national Do-Not-Call (DNC)registry.Publicly available data from government departments and public agencies that havespecific terms of use on who can have access to such data and for what purposes.38",,," What do marketers think they can use the ready-made lists?

92,92,personal data in a data breach,"Many of us use spreadsheets in our everyday work.A single Excelspreadsheet file, for example, can contain up to one million lines of recordsso they are a convenient way to store records and perform useful calculationsand transactions.Very often, spreadsheet users store account, membership, health recordsand transactional information that includes sensitive data such as identitycard numbers, payment card numbers, birthdates and addresses.Under the data protection law, using a spreadsheet negligently can get theuser’s organisation into trouble.Here are some examples of data breachesinvolving spreadsheets:Accidental email attachment #1Willis North America Inc. is an insurance broker and risk adviser.On 19March 2014, one of its employees who was sending a reminder to all of theorganisation’s employees about an upcoming deadline to earn wellnesscredits “accidentally attached a spreadsheet to the email that was not meantto be included”1.The information on the spreadsheet included names, email addresses,dates of birth, social security numbers, employee ID numbers, and officelocations by city/state/zip.It also included wellness credits, individuals’credit status codes, insurance coverage codes and other personal datarelevant to medical insurance.In short, the spreadsheet included all the personal data necessary foridentity theft.While the organisation believed that the personal data in thespreadsheet was not improperly accessed it nevertheless offered allemployees two years of identity theft protection at no charge.Accidental email attachment #2An employee of the University of Mississippi Medical Center2 accidentallyattached a spreadsheet with sensitive information to an email that went out tostudents.The email was meant to alert students to changes being made to theschool’s health insurance scheme.The spreadsheet contained student names, social security numbers, GPAs,race, gender, dates of birth, mailing addresses, and phone numbers.Upondiscovering the breach, the university used a combination of asking studentsto delete the email and manually removing the email from students’ webmailaccounts.Accidental email attachment #3In Singapore, Henry Park Primary School mistakenly sent a spreadsheetcontaining students’ personal data to around 1,900 parents when it updatedthem about a school event.3The school was not within the scope of the data protection law, but theincident caused it embarrassment and immediately attracted unwelcomepublicity.A day after the mistake, the school principal had to send an emailapology to all parents, asking them to delete the spreadsheet and not to usethe personal data in it.Spreadsheet information published online without checkingIn the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) fined the IslingtonCouncil £70,000 for disclosing the personal data of more than 2,000 localresidents when it inadvertently published the data on its website, whichallows people to search through responses to similar requests from publicauthorities.4The source of the information was three spreadsheets that accidentallydisclosed details about whether or not the residents had a history of mentalhealth issues or had suffered from domestic abuse.It also contained detailsof 2,375 council tenants or those who had applied for council housing.Thesewere contained in pivot tablets, which are used in Microsoft Excel tosummarise large amounts of data.According to the investigation, “The person who released this data didnot have sufficient knowledge of spreadsheets to recognise the error or to putit right.”As a result, the council staff responsible had to receive additionaltraining on how to prepare data for public release.Bringing spreadsheets home from the officeBe wary if you bring your work home from the office, especially when itcomes to spreadsheets.An employee from the Hospice of the Chesapeake5 emailed spreadsheetswith sensitive patient information to a personal account in order to workfrom home.The spreadsheet contained names, ages, dates of service,diagnoses, and medical record numbers.The breach was initially suspected to have been caused by a computerintrusion.Hospice of the Chesapeake investigated the breach for two monthsbefore revealing it to the 7,035 patients who were affected.Protecting personal data in spreadsheetsThe data protection law requires an organisation to protect personal data inits possession or under its control.Therefore, an organisation should requireits personnel to password-protect each spreadsheet or the folder in which itis filed.It makes no difference if the file or folder is saved locally or on ashared network drive.The file may also be encrypted to give a higher levelof protection, particularly if the personal data in it is sensitive.Many reported data breaches involve unsecured spreadsheets that weresaved on laptop computers that were subsequently stolen.For example, whena laptop computer was stolen from the vehicle of an employee from YusenLogistics Americas it contained an unencrypted spreadsheet with payrolldeduction information of former and current employees including names,social security numbers, addresses, and payroll benefit deduction6.Most spreadsheet software provides an option for password protection.That way an unauthorised individual will not be able to gain access to thefile.Not securing spreadsheets containing sensitive personal informationwill put your organisation at risk.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and individuals who make use of spreadsheets to process personal dataand other confidential information should take the following precautionary measures:■■■■■■Ensure that all personnel at least password-protect all spreadsheets that containpersonal data.Encryption is advisable, particularly where the personal data is sensitive.Whenever you attach a spreadsheet to an email always double-check to make sure thatit is the correct attachment.Whenever you attach a spreadsheet to an email always double-check to see if itcontains any personal data and, if so, whether or not that personal data may bedisclosed to the recipient(s) of the email.Whenever you attach an email with a pivot table to an email check that the recipient ispermitted to see any personal data that is included in the source information and, if not,make sure that the source information is not still embedded in the pivot table.If you want to work at home, make sure that your organisation’s information securitypolicies permit you to email documents to your personal email so that you can work onthem.Alternatively, make sure that your organisation’s information security policiespermit you to download documents to a tablet and work on them at home or permit youto take your workplace laptop home.If your organisation publishes personal data online in certain circumstances, make surethat you have a fail-safe system in place (such as a second line of verification) to ensurethat only the correct/relevant personal data is published.123456https://www.privacyrights.org/content/willis-north-america-inchttps://www.privacyrights.org/node/57529http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/details-more-1900-pupils-henry-park-primary-school-leakedwww.itpro.co.uk,

(In that case, onlyAviva’s claims employees would have seen the complainant’s personal dataand they would have used it only in connection with the allegation.)The caller, the Aviva employee, was warned of the seriousness of theincident.Aviva used this complaint to draw the attention of other Avivaemployees to the importance of complying with its data protection policiesand practices.Aviva issued a letter to the complainant explaining what had occurred.Aviva apologised for the distress and inconvenience caused to thecomplainant and sent him a voucher for €100 towards his next renewalpremium.Fortunately for Aviva and the employee, the complainant acceptedthis amicable resolution.Banker accessed colleagues’ bank accounts for salary and bonusinformationAn individual worked in a bank’s suspicious activity reporting unit, whichmeant he was able to view customer accounts.He admitted that he used thisaccess to look at eleven colleagues’ accounts to get information about theirsalaries and bonuses.He was fined by the regulator,3 which stated in itsreport that the individual had been given clear training by the bank about thedata protection law, but chose to ignore that training.Hospital employee disclosed health information about a patient to amutual friendA local hospital treated a woman for a serious illness4.A hospital employeehappened to be her close friend.She had access to the case notes about thewoman’s illness and the proposed treatment.With good intent, the hospital employee told a mutual friend that thewoman was unwell.The mutual friend contacted the woman to expressconcern.The woman was upset that her health condition had been disclosedas she had not then told anyone about it.She complained to the regulator,which considered it a breach of the data protection law and that the hospitalhad caused emotional harm to the woman.As a result, the hospital apologised to the woman for the stress that hadbeen caused to her.It also paid her some financial compensation.Health services individuals prosecuted for unauthorised access to personal",,," Who illegally accessed husband's social welfare records?

94,94,The trouble with processing personal data,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
95,95,inaccurately,"Recently, a colleague sent me a joke.It prompted me to think aboutinaccurate personal data and the trouble it can cause.In the joke, a manreceived a note from his neighbour:“Sorry sir I have been using your wife day and night when you are notpresent at home – maybe using more than you are using.Now I feelvery much guilt.Hope you will accept my sincere apologies.”The man went and shot his wife.A few minutes later, he received another message:“Sorry sir, spelling mistake … wifi not wife.”In the joke, a small spelling mistake caused a horrible catastrophe that couldhave been avoided.Under the data protection law, silly mistakes such as theone in the above joke and other simple typos can get organisations intotrouble with the law.Accuracy obligation1All data protection laws include an obligation or principle regarding theaccuracy of personal data.It requires organisations to make a reasonableeffort to ensure that the personal data collected by or on behalf of theorganisation is accurate and complete.While it might not get somebody shot, financial and other penalties can beimposed by the regulator.The penalties vary depending on the seriousness ofthe breach or the damage caused.And relatively minor mistakes can beaggravated by the organisation’s manner of dealing with them.Here are some examples.Unfortunately, they can happen to anybody inyour organisation, but should not happen if your organisation develops andimplements policies and practices to avoid them and trains employees tounderstand the risk of errors and how to apply your organisation’s dataprotection policies and practices.Sending wrong text messages on your mobile deviceBeware when you use your mobile device to send a text message thatincludes personal data.Two factors can easily increase the risk of errors andyour organisation failing to comply with the accuracy obligation in the dataprotection law:■■You are in a hurry and you make mistakes.You use the built-in predictive text function on your device.Thepredictive function may not be as accurate as you think.It can incorrectlysubstitute words that you do not intend, creating an entirely new meaning– like “wifi” to “wife”.The same logic also applies to names and numbers.Double-check anytext messages before you send them, especially when they containpersonal data.Sending personal data to the wrong personYou should use the predictive text function on your mobile device or youremail software very carefully.Otherwise, you could be responsible for yourorganisation breaching the accuracy obligation or principle in the dataprotection law.How many times do we key in the first few letters of somebody’s emailaddress and wait for the email software to fill in the rest of the email detailsfor us?This is indeed convenient.And risky.We inevitably have severalpotential recipients with fairly close names or email addresses and certainlywith the same first few letters in their email address.If you often email personal data, you should check carefully the emailaddress that you select from the list that the predictive function gives to you.Or, even better, disable the predictive function and always key in emailaddresses manually.How about those of us who use the history or event log function on aphone, fax or email application to recall a previous contact, only to retrievethe wrong information?I wonder if the predictive function was responsible when I received thefollowing text message.Or if it was a simple case of the sender making aninput error for the telephone number.Dear <given name and family name> ,We have approved your loan for <$amount> to purchase <addressof property>.Please contact us to arrange for loan drawdown andsettlement .I felt that I should notify them of their error and texted: “You have sent thismessage to the wrong person.Please delete my mobile number from yourrecords.”Unbelievably, they responded with “We cannot communicate with youunless you include your PIN in your message.”Clearly, their employeesending the response had not received adequate training in compliance withthe data protection law.They did not even appear to understand that they haddisclosed another individual’s personal data to me and that their organisationhad therefore failed to comply with the data protection law.Wrongly assuming two people with the same name are the same personBe extra careful when processing personal data about individuals with thesame name, especially when it comes to common names such as John Tan orPeter Lim.Some people take additional care when it comes to very commonnames such as John Tan or Peter Lim but then are caught off-guard by lesscommon names.Very few names are unique.Names recur surprisingly ofteneven in relatively small databases.It is common to match or merge a name in a database for email marketing.Or to search for a particular person to provide a service to them.But there isalways a danger that you will introduce inaccuracies.Always verify theinformation first.Look for other identifiers to give you reasonable assurancethat you have chosen the right person.Some final wordsAs you know, technology might save us a few productive seconds.But as youcan see, technology also exposes us to risks of failing to comply with the dataprotection law.The consequences of doing so might linger for a long time in terms offines, reputational damage or even lawsuits.Technology cannot replace our need to be careful and accurate whenprocessing personal data.Always check and double-check that it is correct.Avoid hurrying and cutting corners.When the purpose for processing personal data is important or evencritical for some reason, such as for decision-making that will likely affectthe individual, an organisation should develop and implement policies andpractices to verify accuracy.For example, one employee of the organisationmight be assigned responsibility for assembling files for some purpose, butanother employee is assigned responsibility for checking it for accuracy andthen using it for that purpose.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIndividuals should exercise care in using or processing personal data to ensure the data isaccurate:■■■■When using the predictive text function on your mobile device or your email software,input your text very carefully.Check carefully the email address that you select from the list that the predictive functiongives to you.Be careful when you use your mobile device to send a text message that includespersonal data.Be extra careful when processing personal data about individuals with the same name.1In some jurisdictions, this would be called the integrity principle.43",,," What caused a horrible catastrophe that could have been avoided?

97,97,unintended consequences,"Without fail, every month for the past few years I have received a remindernotice from my bank about my housing loan payment due that month.It is astandard form of notice that informs me that the bank will deduct $xxxx frommy account on dd/mm/yyyy.It reminds me to make sure I have sufficientfunds in my bank account.I normally do not pay much attention to the detailsin the notice since they are almost the same every month, save for slightvariations in the repayment amount due to fluctuations in the interest rate.On one occasion, I went through the same monthly ritual of opening theenvelope from the bank, retrieving the reminder notice and scanning thecontents quickly to make sure everything was in order.I almost fell off mychair when the repayment amount on the notice was much bigger than usual –six digits instead of four!The bank had substituted my monthly repaymentamount with the balance of the whole loan!I certainly did not have sufficientfunds in my bank account to pay that amount.I phoned the bank immediately to inform them of the grave error.Theircustomer service officer (CSO) very calmly assured me that the bank wasaware of the problem and would send out new reminder notices to allaffected customers.I asked about the cause of the mistake.The CSO said itwas due to a printing error.Not satisfied with the reply, I probed further andasked if it was due to a computer or software error.The CSO stuck to thesame “party line” and repeated adamantly that it was due to a printing error.Lessons we can learn from this incidentReflecting on this incident, I drew a few important lessons about automatedprocesses and the consequences of errors that develop in them and are notdetected by timely checking for accuracy.First, the bank’s computer system has been churning out the samereminder notices to its customers month after month without any mistake.Sothe cause of the error in one month could not be simply a printing error.Printing reminder notices happens right at the end of a chain of processes.So the cause of the mistake could only have been an error in an earlierupstream process.If mistakes in upstream processes are not identified earlyand fixed, their impact on downstream processes can be dire.Second, and worse in this incident, is that the processes are automated.Automated processes should always be sampled periodically for accuracy –in this case, to ensure that the automated process was retrieving customers’loan repayment data accurately, that the data was being incorporatedaccurately into the printed reminder notices and that the deductions fromcustomers’ bank accounts were accurate.A timely check that had discovered, for some reason, the automatedprocess was not retrieving customers’ loan repayment data accurately wouldhave prevented the bank from sending out incorrect reminder notices.Andsaved both customers and CSOs a great deal of time dealing with theresultant complaints.Third, imagine the negative impact on the bank’s reputation among theircustomers who, like me, had checked their reminder notice and called thebank about the error.Apart from anything else, most customers find it simplyannoying to have to waste their time making calls about things that theyexpect the bank to have got right.The negative impact on the bank’s reputation would be even worseamong customers if they had an incorrect deduction made from their bankaccount – without their knowledge if they had not been vigilant in checkingtheir reminder notices.The incorrect deduction would have reduced their account balance tobelow what they expected.Likely consequences of a lower account balanceinclude cheques being bounced by the bank and the bank not making GIROpayments due to insufficient funds remaining in the account.Consequencesfor the customer of bounced cheques and failed GIRO payments may includepersonal embarrassment and loss of reputation, plus penalties imposed bythird-parties for late payment to them.Consequences for the bank might evenextend to lawsuits by customers to recoup their losses caused by the bank’sincorrect deduction from their bank account.Some speculation on the root cause of the errorBarring any malicious attack on the bank’s computer systems by insiders oroutsiders, I would hazard a guess on some plausible causes that led to the so-called “printing error”:■■■The database system was upgraded or modified.That upgrade ormodification upset the indexing system.Instead of the index pointing tothe monthly repayment amount, it pointed to the total loan balanceinstead.Some modules of the application system were upgraded or modified,which affected the logic of other existing modules.Fixing software bugs in one part of the application system affected thelogic of other parts of the system.",,," What does it remind me to do?

98,98,Unintended Consequences,"“Unintended consequences” in the context of automated processes are theoutcomes and effects of unanticipated causes that the application or softwaredesigner could not have foreseen.What can be done to prevent them?If one of the causes listed above iscorrect, the bank obviously did not conduct sufficient “user acceptancetesting” of the upgrade, modification or bug fix – which would have detectedthe error – before “going live”.Testing should not be confined to software modules that have beenchanged or replaced.It should extend to the whole application system(system testing) and the integration of the new software modules withexisting modules (integration testing).Testing should also include the impactof the new software modules on the logic of existing or interrelated modules(regression testing).Had the bank tested the new printouts it should have discovered themistakes and not sent incorrect reminder notices to customers.Too often,organisations are in a hurry to launch new application systems as quickly aspossible and do not put enough emphasis on rigorous testing and validation.Sometimes organisations cut costs by doing only minimal testing andvalidation without taking into account the cost of complaints and loss ofreputation caused by system errors.Compliance with accuracy requirements of the data protection lawsThe data protection laws include an obligation or principle requiringorganisations to make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of personaldata, particularly where it may be used to make a decision.Organisations therefore need to be able to assure individuals that thepersonal data in their possession or under their control is accurate.Thisincludes personal data in IT systems with automated processing.There is no shortcut to rigorous IT system testing before the organisation“goes live” with them.Rigorous testing is absolutely necessary to reduce therisk of unanticipated consequences resulting from errors, which can beprevented or avoided before it is too late.It is a mistake to seek to cut costsby reducing system testing without taking into account the risk of reputationalloss arising from system errors.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations that regularly process customers’ data should take the followingprecautionary measures:■■■Ensure that customers’ personal data and transactions are processed accurately.Beware of unintended consequences that could be caused by changes in internalprocesses or upgrading of the IT systems.Any new software module introduced or any existing software module modified shouldbe thoroughly tested to ensure that there are no unintended consequences.44",,," What should not be confined to?

(Thisalone is a good reason why individuals should not disclose their date of birthon social media.But in some countries it can be obtained from publicrecords anyway.)In countries that have a national identity card system, the identity cardmay be used widely for all sorts of transactions so a fraudster might see it ina range of contexts.It may even be obtained from some public records, suchas records of property ownership or records of company officers.Voila!The fraudster has all the necessary information required to pass offas a bona fide customer.What are banks doing about the shortcomings in identity verification?The banks are well aware of the shortcomings I’ve described above.Mostbanks have tightened the procedure they use to verify the identity of theircustomers.One common practice is to ask customers additional questions such aswhich school they attended, their mother’s maiden name or their pet’s name.If the customer has been an active user of social media, a fraudster mighteasily obtain the answers to these questions.Some banks ask additional bank-related questions that a fraudster isunlikely to be able to answer, such as “What loans have you taken from thebank?” “How many credit/debit cards issued by us do you have?”Two-factor/multi-factor authentication in phone bankingSome banks have implemented a two-factor or multi-factor authenticationscheme.This is more secure than the one-factor authentication mentionedabove.But the way my bank does it is rather cumbersome.I have to put myconversation with the CSO on hold, while I call another number provided bythe CSO.This second number sends a text message to the mobile phonenumber in the bank’s records.It is a one-time code that I need to send to theCSO to verify my identity.How I wish I could have dual SIM cards on my mobile phone so Iwouldn’t have to toggle between two phone connections using a singlenumber.This phone banking user experience of two-factor authentication is a farcry from that experienced in Internet or online banking.Nevertheless, it is asecure step forward.Two-factor/multi-factor authentication in Internet or online bankingIn Internet or online banking, besides the user ID and password, the customermust key in a one-time code generated from a physical token issued by thebank to the customer.Alternatively, the one-time code can also be sent to thecustomer’s mobile phone number or email address.Onus on organisations to verify the identity of their customersBanks must be vigilant in verifying their customers’ identity.CSOs must seekto detect any instance where another individual calls in on behalf of thecustomer or does not personally have all the information on hand to verify thecustomer’s identity.Some banks will terminate a call if the CSO hears theperson on the phone asking someone in the background for any informationthat may relate to the bank verifying the caller.Sometimes some assistance from another person may be perfectlylegitimate – the bank might ask callers about the year they opened theiraccount and the callers might have forgotten but know that their spouseswould have kept a record of it.But the bank can’t take any chances because afamily member or some other person close to the customer can easily gethold of all the customer’s verification information.They might even haveeasy access to the customer’s cheque book or identity card.There have beencases of ex-spouses of customers pretending to call on their behalf to enquireabout the customers’ banking activities or other assets kept with the bankwhich the ex-spouses are not supposed to know about.Data protection law requirements apply tooBanks are typically required by banking legislation to keep customers’details confidential.In addition, banks and other organisations are requiredby the data protection law to protect personal data in their possession orunder their control.This of course includes not disclosing it improperly.In summary, banks and other organisations should verify the identity oftheir customers carefully before disclosing any personal data or any otherconfidential information to them.Not to do so thoroughly is to invite troubleor negative consequences, including penalties for failing to comply with thedata protection law.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations (for example, banks) should implement the following practices to verify theidentities of their customers:■■■in phone banking, go beyond asking the standard questions; preferably ask bank-relatedquestions which only the customer will know the answers to.Use two-factor/multi-factor authentication if feasible.Do not allow someone to call on behalf of the customer to enquire about the customer’sbanking activities or assets kept with the bank.45",,," Why do some people dislike phone banking?

101,101,Trusting organisations for the accuracy of,"our transaction dataI invite you to answer three questions before you read this chapter:■ Do you keep all the credit card slips you have signed so that you canverify your monthly credit card statement from your bank or other creditcard issuer against them?Do you also keep track of any credit cardtransactions where you do not sign a credit card slip?■ Do you keep your own records of all the transactions in your bankaccount so that you can verify your monthly bank statement against them?(Transactions you need to keep track of include ATM cash withdrawals,cash deposited, cheques drawn, cheques deposited, debit card paymentsat point-of-sale and GIRO deductions.)■ Do you keep your own records of all transactions on your mobile phoneaccount so that you can verify the monthly bill against them?(Transactions you need to keep track of if you have a post-paid planinclude the number of text messages you sent and whether they are localor international, the number of call minutes you used, the volume of datayou transmitted or received, the number of call minutes you used on voiceroaming and the countries where these were used, the volume of data youtransmitted or received on data roaming and the countries where thesewere used.)If you answer “yes” to all three questions, you are among an endangeredspecies.In all likelihood, the majority of us would answer “no” to at leastone, if not all, of these questions.Not that we are lazy, but it is too tediousand time-consuming to keep such records.Sometimes it is near impossiblefor us to do the record-keeping without special equipment or computersystems, as in the mobile phone example.So the man-in-the-street wisdom isthat “I have to trust the monthly statements from the banks, credit card issuersand mobile phone operators since they have the responsibility to keep trackof my transactions”.But can you be 100% sure that your transactional data captured andprocessed by these organisations is 100% accurate all the time?Worst-case scenarios for customersScary thoughts of “worst-case scenarios” have crossed my mind a few times,and some of these have even turned to reality for me:■■What if the bank or other credit card issuer has overcharged me and Ihave no documentary evidence to prove it?I have been charged twice forone transaction at point-of-sale.The bank reversed the duplicate chargewhen I brought it to their attention.When hit with a massive mobile phone bill, how do I know whetherfigures such as the call minutes and the volume of data transmitted andreceived have been accurately captured and computed, especially whenthe usage was in an overseas country and recorded by a foreign mobilephone operator?Here are two personal anecdotes:■ In the first episode, I noticed about 50 voice roaming entries in mymonthly bill.These occurred over two days.They all had the same phonenumber.They all had a call duration of 1–2 seconds.When I brought this inaccurate charging to the mobile phone■operator’s attention they waived the charges immediately, because theybelieved that the calls could not have originated from a human being.The50 voice roaming entries obviously arose from an error in their meteringsystem.In the second episode, I was charged for data roaming while overseaswhen I had switched off the data roaming service on my mobile phonebefore leaving home.This episode turned out to be a battle of sorts between the mobilephone operator and me.They insisted that the settings on my mobilephone were wrong.I denied that accusation vehemently.I had been to thesame country monthly over two years and did exactly the same thingsbefore I left home.And this was the first time such an incident happened.The matter was eventually resolved after many weeks when seniormanagement of the mobile phone operator intervened and waived all thedata roaming charges.It sounds ironic but the only way we know how much money we have in ourbank accounts today is to ask the bank. (The same goes for our accounts withinsurance companies and some other organisations, including publicagencies.)What if there are inaccuracies in the transactions the bank capturesand processes?What if there is fraud by a bank employee – for example, theysiphon off small amounts from each bank account and no one is the wiser?I’ve had a double deduction of the same amount under a GIRO to thesame payee within the same month.This was rectified when the bankadmitted it had caused the error.What can customers do?Granted that all banks and other financial institutions in Singapore aregoverned by strict laws to ensure the accuracy of the transactional data oftheir customers and to prevent unauthorised modification to such data, butnothing is fool-proof.Even the best processes and technological tools deployed have theirlimitations.Customers have to be their own watchdogs.Short of theimpracticality of 100% verification of statements issued by the banks, othercredit card issuers and mobile phone operators, customers should scrutinisetheir statements to spot anomalies.Like in the few anecdotes I shared above, I would not have noticed theinaccuracies in the transactional data processed by these companies if not forthe “lightning rods” that stuck out.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES■■Organisations that maintain accounts of their customers’ transactions, such as banks,credit card issuers and mobile phone operators, have a great responsibility to ensure theaccuracy of such data.Customers, on the other hand, have to be their own watchdogs to spot anomalies in theirmonthly statements of account issued by banks, credit card companies and mobilephone operators.46",,,"do you keep all the credit card slips you have signed so that you canverify your monthly credit card statement from your bank or other creditcard issuer against them?Do you also keep track of any credit cardtransactions where you do not sign a credit card slip?

105,105,vulnerability for personal data breach,"In some countries every individual citizen or permanent resident has a uniqueidentifier assigned to them by the government for the purpose of work,taxation, government benefits and other government-related functions.Due to“function creep” it becomes used for other purposes, including commercialpurposes.Sometimes it even becomes a substitute for other identifiers, suchas membership identification numbers in organisations.In Singapore and some other countries the national identifier stays withthe individual “from cradle to grave”, or at least from citizenship to grave.Or while an individual is a permanent resident, or even a temporary resident,of the country.Such identifiers are now considered so important foreconomic and financial inclusion in the digital age that India, for example,has embarked on a huge project to assign national identifiers to all residents.Not surprisingly, privacy advocates have raised concerns about uniqueidentifiers.Increasingly, unique identifiers now play an insidious role inidentity theft.For these reasons they are typically considered to be sensitivepersonal data, even in those countries where the data protection law does notdraw a legal distinction between sensitive personal data and other personaldata.Nevertheless, in countries that do have national identifiers it is commonfor individuals to just rattle off their identity card number or whip out theiridentity card upon request without questioning or batting an eyelid.Theyfreely allow service providers to photocopy their identity card for recordpurposes or surrender their identity card to the security guard at acondominium or commercial building in exchange for a security pass.The downside of these practices is that they have inadvertently providedto an outsider, who may or may not be trusted, the “master key” to personaldata about them that is sensitive.Changing practicesData protection laws have the effect, over time, of individuals becomingmore aware of the importance of safeguarding their identity card number –not to disclose it unnecessarily to outside parties without knowing the reasonor purpose.Organisations are also changing their practices to not insist onusing the identity card number as the default means of identification ofindividuals.Data protection regulators generally suggest that organisationsshould use other forms of personal identification as far as practicable incircumstances where an individual’s identity does need to be confirmed.On one occasion, I went to a redemption centre to claim a free gift.Thecustomer service officer (CSO) asked me to produce my identity card.Iqueried the need for it.The CSO told me that the organisation wanted aphotocopy of it for their records.When I said that I felt uncomfortable abouthanding it over, the CSO said without hesitation that it was optional.On another occasion, I stepped into a medical specialist’s clinic for thefirst time.The receptionist asked me to fill in a form that asked for my name,identity card number, date of birth, address and phone number.I said that Iwould prefer not to give my identity card number and the receptionist saidthat was okay.Complying with the data protection lawFrom the perspective of the data protection law, the organisations I mentionabove need to change their requests and forms.Arguably, simply not pressingtheir requirements when challenged is better than the alternative, but it is notenough for compliance with the data protection law.In addition, there areother obligations under the data protection law such as the requirement toprotect personal data like identity card numbers.■■■Organisations need to review their business practices:They should not seek confirmation of identity from individuals when it isnot necessary.They should not make and keep a copy of an individual’s identity cardwhen merely sighting it to confirm the individual’s identity would besufficient.They should use less sensitive forms of identification wherever possible– a mobile phone number, for example, would usually be sufficient todistinguish between individuals with the same name.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should handle individuals’ identity card numbers with care:■■An individual’s identity card number is like a “master key” to the individual’s identity andother personal data.If possible, they should use other forms of identification, such as a mobile phonenumber.SECTION E:Physical & EnvironmentalSecurity“Security in IT is like locking your house or car – it doesn’t stop the bad guys, but if it’sgood enough they may move on to an easier target.”Paul Herbka“You can’t hold firewalls and intrusion detection systems accountable.You can only holdpeople accountable.”Daryl White 49",,," Which country has embarked on a huge project to assign national identifiers to all residents?

106,106,The dangers lurking in public computer,"terminalsMany individuals work “on the road” – for example, real estate sales people,financial advisers and independent sales agents.For them, it’s often quickand easy to rely on public computer terminals or work stations belonging totheir agency to carry out transactions and administration work.Five important questions to answer when working on public terminalsIf you are a mobile worker, here are five questions for you:1.Do you ensure that your user name and password are not saved in anyweb applications?2.Do you delete your browsing history before you log out of thecomputer?3.Do you refrain from processing financial or sensitive personalinformation (such as banking transactions)?4.Have you cleared everything you loaded or downloaded into thecomputer (including any USB drive and any documents you have sentfor printing, and, if you deleted any files, have you emptied theterminal’s electronic recycling bin)?5.Do you always remember to log out when you leave the computer?If your answer to any of the above is “no”, you may fail to comply with thedata protection law.For example, you might unintentionally expose your ownand your clients’ personal data to individuals who are not authorised to seeit.And if that’s not bad enough, given that competition is very high amongproperty agents and financial advisers, you might unintentionally exposevaluable commercial information to your competitors.They might “steal”your clients’ personal data when you inadvertently leave it for them to find.Never save passwords in a browser, web form or application“Why would I be stupid enough to save passwords when I’m using a publicterminal?”,you may ask.The answer is that you could be doing itunintentionally.Especially when you are in a hurry or are distracted by multi-tasking, like speaking to someone on the phone while you are using the publicterminal.Saving passwords can happen when you sign into an account or submit aweb form.The browser prompts you about whether you want to rememberyour sign-in ID and password.Particularly if you routinely say “yes” athome, you instinctively say “yes” without thinking when you are using apublic terminal and are in a hurry or are distracted.If you do, you make your sign-in ID and password available to otherindividuals using the same terminal after you.You give them the keys togaining access to your password-protected account or website, for example.If you happen to make this mistake, here is how you can rectify it (if youragency has not already turned off the auto-save feature – you can find moredetailed instructions for the various browsers if you search online):■Firefox : Tools > Click on Options, Security tab, “Saved Passwords”,delete specific ones or all of them.■■■Internet Explorer : Tools > Click on Internet Options, Content tab,Autocomplete [> settings], delete autocomplete history.Google Chrome : Click on Chrome Control Panel Button > Settings(chrome://settings/) > Show advanced settings… > Passwords and forms> Offer to save your web passwords (uncheck)Safari : Click on Safari > Preferences > Autofill > Uncheck box for Usernames and passwordsMake it a habit never to auto-save your user information and password.Inthis way you may secure your online privacy and presence.Don’t forget toinform your agency or organisation if you notice that the auto-save browserfeature is turned on while browsing the Web.The IT administrator andperson in charge can take action and implement this for all the publicterminals.Delete your browsing or search history and cookies before you log out ofthe computerWhy should you care about deleting your browsing or search history andcookies before you log out of a public computer terminal?Let’s say you visit a website offering cancer advice or one offering loans.If you do not delete your history, the next individual who uses the terminalcan pretty much infer your intent from looking at your search history.This isbecause the browser’s predictive search feature immediately revealsprevious sites visited.Maybe you care whether the next individual knows what sites you havevisited; maybe you ordinarily do not.But it could create a big problem foryou, especially if you had been on, say, an Internet banking site and you hadalso inadvertently saved your ID and password.(You can easily find instructions online about how to clear your browsinghistory.)Better safe than sorry – use the private browsing featureAll popular web browsers have a private browsing feature.Sometimes it iscalled “privacy mode” and sometimes it is called “incognito mode”.Itenables an individual to disable their browsing history and the web cacheresulting from their browsing.The individual can browse the web withoutstoring local data that could be retrieved later, including by a stranger.To be safe, always use the private browsing feature when using a publicterminal to visit websites.In addition, it is a good idea to delete cookies in the terminal.A cookie isa small piece of software or mechanism that allows the server (website) tostore its own information about a user such as preferences and what webpages were visited on the user’s own computer.You can view the cookiesthat have been stored on your hard disk (though they may not make sense toyou).In short, you should leave no traces of your identity or actions.Refrain from processing financial or sensitive personal dataFor at least the following three reasons, you should refrain from processingfinancial or sensitive personal data when you are using a public computerterminal.The first reason is a simple practical one: shared public terminals arerarely located in areas that provide a reasonable level of privacy.If you aredoing a banking transaction, for example, the information you input into yourbank’s online banking portal can be exposed to prying eyes easily.Inaddition, you could easily misplace sensitive documents or lose securitytokens issued to you by your bank.Second, an unauthorised individual might have installed malware such asa key-logger on the public terminal so that they can track what you type intothe computer.If that is your bank account details, bank ID and password, theconsequences for you might be very serious.Finally, if you really have no choice but to do an online transaction on ashared public terminal and are confident that you can do so privately, youshould proceed only if the URL of your destination site has got “https”displayed in your browser’s address bar.HTTPS is a protocol for securecommunication over a computer network which is widely used on the Internetso you can be assured that the data you submit over the Internet is encrypted.Clear everything you have loaded or downloaded into the computerIt seems obvious, of course, that an individual using a public computerterminal would clear it of everything they have uploaded or downloaded intothe computer.But we are surprised how often we find documents and filescopied into a computer, in that an individual who sends an email or prints thedocument and then forgets to delete it.In our audits we find terminals that are littered with documents thatcontain personal data.They include transaction documents, application formsand even images of identity cards.Typically, these documents easily identifythe agent or salesperson concerned and implicate them in the failure tocomply with the data protection law that arises from failing to protect thepersonal data.Then there are the confidential documents, including loose sheets ofpaper, or items such as USB drives left behind at the terminals.The contentsof the loose sheets of paper are obviously easily accessible.The USB drivesare rarely password-protected or encrypted, so personal data or otherconfidential information on them is usually easily accessible too.It is veryevident that the negligent culprit – again, often identifiable by what has beenleft behind – has not taken any reasonable security measures to protect therelevant personal data or other confidential information.Log out when you leave the computerFinally, please log out of your account when you leave the terminal.It is sucha basic requirement but we do find many individuals forgetting to do so – orsimply being too lazy to do so.If you are fortunate, your agency ororganisation may have a reboot or auto-log out function, which immediatelyresets the account and initiates the log-out process.You should also log outeven when you need to leave the shared terminal for a short while, such as togo into another room to fetch a document or file, to get a cup of tea or even togo to the restroom.It’s better to be safe than sorry.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIndividuals should exercise great caution when using public computer terminals:■■■■■Never save passwords in a browser, web form or application.Delete your browsing and search history and cookies before you log out of the computer.Use the private browsing feature within the browser to maintain privacy of your browsinghistory.Clear everything you have uploaded or downloaded into the computer.Don’t forget toempty the recycle bin.Log out when you leave the computer.51",,," What types of people work on the road?

formats,becoming an international multi-media phenomenon that was translated intomore than 30 languages.The centrepiece, the “Hitch-Hiker’s Guide” was asmall portable device used to look up pretty much any information aboutanything in the galaxy, the Milky Way.By 2017, over a third of the world’s population – an estimated total ofalmost 2.6 billion individuals – is projected1 to have a portable computer intheir pocket or handbag.This is a dream come true and science fiction turnedinto reality, albeit earthbound.Of course, we call this class of computingdevices “smartphones”.Since Apple Inc. introduced its first generation of the iPhone in 2007,today’s smartphones have been able to do almost anything a much largerpersonal computer (PC) can do.In addition, smartphone users can makephone calls around the world through cellular networks, which a PC can’tdo.Smartphones have revolutionised our lives so much that they havebecome indispensable to us.We can’t leave home without them.Asmartphone is at once:■■■our mobile office where we can access our organisation’s emails anddatabasesour learning centre where we can tap on the wealth of information aroundthe globe andour

post”“C & P” refers to “cut and paste” or “copy and paste” when we work onelectronic documents.With smartphones, “C & P” refers to “capture andpost”.Trigger-happy users of smartphones use them to snap photos, recordvoice conversations and capture video footage.They then post them online orto social media platforms in a matter of seconds.Nothing can escape theirattention, all for the sake of being the first to post the most “juicy” news orgossip.Or even news of an emergency, as shown in the sign in a publicbuilding warning the occupants to exit the building quickly in a fire instead ofstaying

information security.The camera and voice recorder built into smartphones provide users,including every employee of the organisation, with instant “tools” forcapturing personal data and other confidential information that they are notpermitted to take out of their offices.Worse, a visitor walking within theoffice unescorted can easily take photos of confidential files or documentslying around on unattended work desks, or of confidential informationdisplayed on computer terminals.At meetings, individuals can surreptitiously turn on the voice recorder ontheir smartphones to record conversations concerning sensitive matters.Attendees can quickly whip out their smartphones to capture images ofpersonal data and other confidential information presented on the largescreen when the presenter’s back is turned or is looking down.At one board meeting, I was quite intrigued to observe that the minute-taker was hardly taking down any notes while conversations were going on atrapid pace.The answer?The voice recorder on the individual’s smartphonerecorded every relevant bit – as well as every juicy bit – of theconversations, including the grunts, groans, sighs and coughs.I did not noticethat the voice recorder was turned on because the smartphone was placedinconspicuously on the conference table, encased in a wraparound cover.What should organisations do?Organisations should adopt at least the following basic measures to preventemployees and visitors alike from taking photos of confidential documents orrecording conversations using smartphones, while in the office premises:■■Display notices at prominent places, especially in meeting rooms whereoutsiders are present, to remind people not to take any photos or recordany conversation without the permission of the person-in-charge, such asthe chairman of the meeting or the most senior person present.Remind employees to shield their confidential documents and computerterminals from being viewed by those without a “need to know”whenever they are away from their work desks, even for a short period oftime.They can do so by covering or closing their files or locking them in■drawers or cabinets.They can lock their computer terminals using asoftware utility.Have visitors deposit their smartphones at the receptionist’s counterwhen they need to enter highly secure and restricted areas of theorganisation.Dawn of wearable computersHaving addressed the privacy concerns brought about by smartphones,organisations and their employees responsible for privacy and informationsecurity cannot afford to rest on their laurels.More and more innovative“smart” devices are being introduced to consumers at a steady stream.Are you old enough to remember the crime-solving detective, Dick Tracy,from the American comic strip and later film versions?His two-way wristradio was a centrepiece of his stories and a “brand icon” – not least becausethe idea was so unbelievable when the comic strip was introduced in 1931.Now wearable computers in the form of smart watches, for example,have entered the mainstream.While the current functions of these smartwatches are rather limited, they may already include two-way voicecommunication.If not, it is surely only a matter of time before two-waycommunication, as well as camera and voice recorder features, areincorporated into them. (Indeed, it may happen between my writing this andyour reading it.)Highlighting pens that can scan paper documents and digitise them line-by-line are already available in the market.Google Glass2 was introduced to consumers as a prototype in May 2014.It resembles a pair of eyeglasses.It displays information to the user in asmartphone-like hands-free format.Wearers communicate with the Internetusing natural language voice commands.Because of its ability to take photosor record videos, Google Glass caused quite a stir among those peopleconcerned with its invasion of privacy.In January 2015, Google Glass waspulled off the shelves.In December 2015, Google commenced work on thenext version of Google Glass.Looking ahead to the not-too-distant future, we can anticipate yet moresophisticated types of wearable computers, long the dream of science-fictionwriters, coming onto the market.Buttons, cuff-links or brooches on jacketsthat function as cameras and voice recorders, and special hand gloves thatcan digitise paper documents with a wave of the hand, are already withinscientific capabilities.The final wordOrganisations and their employees responsible for privacy and informationsecurity must keep up with technologies to stay relevant and remain on top ofnew data protection/privacy challenges.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should do the following to prevent people from taking photos of confidentialdocuments or recording conversations using smartphones:■■■Display notices at prominent places to remind people not to take photos or recordconversations without permission.Remind employees to shield their private and confidential documents and their computerterminals from being viewed by those without a “need to know”.Have visitors deposit their smartphones at the receptionist’s counter when they need toenter highly secure and restricted areas.12See http://www.statista.com/topics/840/smartphones/.Source: Wikipedia, under the entry “Google Glass”SECTION F:Security, Storage, Retention &Disposal of Personal Data“We’ve seen a ton of archiving companies developing data-protection technologiesduring the last six months … We’ve seen a lot of search engine companies looking atways to access this information too.”Brian Babineau“Phishing is a major problem because there really is no patch for human stupidity.”Mike Danseglio 54",,," What galaxy is the Hitch-Hiker's Guide?

114,114,the human factor in preventing data,"breachesWe decided to analyse all the recent mega data breach cases to see if humanerror was either directly or indirectly the main cause.2014 was the year of mega breachesTake a look at the following data breaches which involved millions ofaccounts, all of which happened in 2014. (At the time of writing, resultswere not all in for 2015.)Source: http://www.informationisbeautiful.net■■■■■■■JP Morgan Chase & Co (76 million households and 7 million smallbusinesses affected)eBay (145 million people affected)Home Depot (56 million unique payment cards affected)CHS Community Health Systems (4.5 million people affected)Michaels Stores (2.6 million people affected)Nieman Marcus (1.1 million people affected)Staples (point-of-sale systems at 115 retail stores affected)No wonder a commissioned report by the Ponemon Institute was called“2014: Year of the Mega Breaches”.1Human error, the trigger of data breachesLet’s take a look at a few of the breaches in a little more detail.■JP Morgan ChaseAn employee of JP Morgan Chase, working from home, was a victim ofphishing.Phishing is a common hacking technique where the victim is lured intoclicking on a malicious link masquerading as a trustworthy entity.Behindthese links are various electronic methods of stealing user credentials ormalicious codes designed to clandestinely give the attacker control of theuser’s computing devices.The hapless employee, making a human error, clicked on such a link.■Hackers then penetrated the bank’s network through the employee’sinfected computer.eBayAccording to eBay, their data breach occurred when cyber attackerscompromised a small number of employee log-in credentials.Thisallowed unauthorised access to eBay’s corporate network.Again, we can attribute this to human error.We don’t know if the■credentials were compromised by keylogging malware or by a phishingattack.But it was obvious that there were no added security measuressuch as two-factor authentication.Home DepotHome Depot suffered the largest retail card breach on record.It involvedmalware that infected its point-of-sale system.The malware wasdesigned to siphon data from payment cards when swiped at infectedpoints-of-sale.The question is, how did the malware get into the point-of-sale■system?Was it because there was a download from an infected websiteor because somebody clicked on a malicious link?Either way, it seemsclear that there was human error.TargetTarget’s data breach happened in late 2013.It affected the personal data,including payment card numbers, of more than 70 million individuals.An air-conditioning contractor working in Target stores had access toits IT system.A successful phishing attack compromised the contractor’slog-in credentials.They were used to access Target’s internal contractorbilling system.From there, the hackers accessed Target’s server thatmanaged the billing system application, changed the access permissions,and gained access to Target’s internal networks.The hackers thenuploaded their malware to Target’s point-of-sale system and used themalware to collect millions of credit card numbers, which were then soldon the black market.This attack may have involved at least two human errors: thecontractor’s error that allowed a successful phishing attack and, possibly,insufficient internal system controls that allowed the malware installedby the hackers to move through Target’s IT system from the contractorbilling system to the point-of-sale system.Your employees can get your organisation into trouble with the lawThe above data breaches happened in organisations that individuals wouldtrust to take the greatest care of their personal data.Yet the breacheshappened.Did they necessarily mean that there were no security policies, practicesand technology systems in place?No.The common denominator was thehuman factor.Employee negligence or error, the cause of data breachesWe then looked at available research to see the extent to which employees orother insiders were the direct or indirect cause of data breaches.Here areour research results:■■According to the IBM Security Services 2014 Cyber SecurityIntelligence Index2, over 95% of all incidents investigated recognisehuman error as a contributing factor to data breaches.A very high percentage was also reported by Experian’s Data BreachIndustry Forecast Report3, where “employees and negligence are theleading cause of security incidents but remain the least reported issue.”According to one of its executives, of 3,100 incidents that Experian DataBreach Resolution surveyed in 2014, “81% had a root cause in employeenegligence”.The most common issue was the loss of administrative credentials – username and password.But there were also lost media, firewalls left open andlost laptops.The report also highlighted that “employees and negligence are theleading cause of security incidents but remain the least reported issue”.■ From a regulator’s perspective, figures from the InformationCommunications Office (ICO) in the UK, in a Freedom of Information(FoI) report, reveal that humans, not machines, are responsible for 93%of data breaches.A quarter of all data breaches between April and June 2014 involved■the accidental loss or destruction of personal data.In a study by Ponemon Institute of 584 IT professionals whoseorganisations had been breached in 2012, the following causes wererevealed:••••••34% were caused by a negligent insider16% were caused by malicious insiders19% were a result of outsourcing data to a third-party11% were a result of systems glitches7% were the product of a cyber attack6% were triggered by a failure to shred confidential documentsSo, in this study, 50% of breaches were caused by insiders.Taking insidersof third-parties into account, the number is likely close to 70%.Whichever report you choose, the human factor is a major cause ortrigger of data breaches.Implications on data protection law – and the importance of operationalcomplianceWe expect that mega breaches and emerging technologies such as big data,cloud computing, social media, mobility and the “Internet of things” willcreate regulatory pressures that bring about stricter data protection laws.Organisations in Asia and the European Union will need to deal withnew legal requirements.But legal compliance is not enough, as the abovecases demonstrate.The key for organisations is to achieve operationalcompliance – to overcome the human factor.If organisations adopt operational compliance practices and an employeefails to comply with them, resulting in a data breach, the regulator might taketheir existence into account.For example, a regulator might count them as amitigating factor in assessing any penalty for the organisation failing tocomply with the data protection law.Or it might not, depending on thecircumstances of the lapse.Generally, regulators require organisations to demonstrate some sort ofaccountability – defined as responsibility, ownership and evidence – fortheir operational compliance policies.The final wordThe conclusion is a simple one: humans are the weakest link in anyorganisation.An organisation may have implemented the best data lossprevention software, end-point security or encryption technology.But all ittakes is just one ignorant, careless or disgruntled employee to ruin all thegood work done from an operational perspective.Effective internal training can help manage the risk of ignorantemployees.Regular auditing of compliance with policies and practices canhelp to manage the risk of ignorant employees too, as well as the risk ofcareless employees.Restricting access to personal data on a “need to know”basis might assist in managing the risk of disgruntled employees.Good automated methods to track access to, and use of, personal data anddiligent review of their records to monitor compliance with policies andpractices may identify problems at an early stage and even stop disgruntledemployees in their tracks.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should be aware of the main causes of data breaches and shouldimplement precautionary or mitigating measures to minimise the occurrence of databreaches:■■■Understand that more than 50% of data breaches are the result of the human factor.Ensure the your organisation implements operational compliance practices – legalcompliance is not enough.Train employees and raise their awareness in operational compliance and informationsecurity.123http://www.ponemon.org/local/upload/file/2014%20The%20Year%20of%20the%20Mega%20Breach%20FINAL3.pdfSee

115,115,Sending sensitive documents – learning,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
116,116,from data breaches by law firms,"You would think that law firms would be the last organisations to get intotrouble with the data protection law since they know the legal requirementsinside out.Right?Wrong.And this illustrates that compliance is not just about legal compliance –for example, ensuring that the various legal contracts, data protectionpolicies and consent clauses are in place.There needs to be operationalcompliance too.And it’s operational compliance that has tripped them up.Here are a few data breaches that happened to law firms due tooperational compliance failures.We can learn from them because they mightalso happen to any other type of organisation delivering or sendingconfidential documents.Unsecured trial documents deliveredAn employee of a law firm delivered documents relating to a matrimonialtrial to its client.The documents contained sensitive personal data about theclient.The employee left the documents in a gap between the front door andthe metal gate at the client’s residence.To aggravate matters, the documentswere not sealed in an envelope and were easily accessible to passersby andunrelated parties.It happened that a security guard on patrol picked them up.The client complained to the regulator.1 It found the law firm, being theemployer of the negligent staff, liable for the privacy breach.Theinvestigations by the regulator revealed that the firm had no writtenguidelines advising its employees about compliance with the relevantrequirements of the data protection law, especially with regard to deliveringsensitive documents.Careless disclosure of sensitive information through acknowledgementreceiptA law firm arranged for documents relating to a matrimonial case to bedelivered to a party to the case at that individual’s office.The originaldocuments were placed in a sealed envelope.However, there was aduplicate of the documents for the recipient to sign to acknowledge receipt.The duplicate was not covered in any way.It contained the suit number of theproceedings and the names of the parties to it.When the messenger arrived at the office he placed both the sealedenvelope and the duplicate copy of the documents on the reception desk andtook a seat to wait for the recipient.The receptionist inevitably read the frontpage of the duplicate documents.They could also be read by any personpassing by the reception desk.When the recipient discovered this, she was upset that her involvement indivorce proceedings had been disclosed to others in her office andcomplained to the regulator2.The law firm argued to the regulator that the front page of the duplicatedocuments showed merely the suit number of the proceedings and the namesof the parties.It said that these details were accessible to the public at thecourt registry.It argued that therefore this was not confidential personal data.■■■The regulator said that:the law firm failed to take practical steps to safeguard the personal datain this contextthe data was still of a sensitive nature to the individual concerned,particularly in her workplace andsuch “information was unnecessarily brought to the notice of persons whoin all likelihood would not otherwise have had knowledge of it and thishad caused distress to the complainant”.Therefore, the regulator considered that the law firm had failed to complywith the data protection law.The case was settled by mediation after the lawfirm accepted the regulator’s findings.Letter without cover acknowledged and read by receptionistA messenger for a law firm hand-delivered a letter to a client of the law firmwithout any cover to the client’s office.The messenger asked the receptionistto sign a copy of the letter as acknowledgement of receipt.The receptionist called the client and read out part of the letter to theclient.This upset the client.The letter contained reference to court actionsinvolving the client and, as a result of the messenger delivering the letterfrom the law firm, the receptionist now knew about them.The client complained to the regulator3 that the law firm had disclosedher personal data to the receptionist and the messenger.The law firmadmitted to the breach and undertook to put remedial measures in place.These included not disclosing a client’s personal data whenever deliveringany document or when getting any acknowledgement of delivery.The lawfirm also undertook to give clear instructions to its employees about thepurposes of complying with these requirements.Confidential legal documents faxed by lawyer without checking withrecipientA solicitor in a law firm sent confidential legal documents to a private faxnumber of the Chief Executive Officer of an insurance company meant for anemployee4.But here is the problem: this employee had set up their ownprivate business, presumably without their company’s knowledge.Thesolicitor apparently obtained the fax number by searching through theInternet.The number was the general fax number of the insurance company.As a result, the documents were delivered to the CEO, prompting theemployee to complain to the regulator against the law firm for disclosingtheir personal data without consent.The law firm confirmed that sending legal documents containing personaldata to a fax number, which would enable persons other than the intendedrecipient to have sight or easy access to the documents, contravened itspolicy.It told the regulator that it had reminded its solicitors of such policyduring internal meetings.However, there was no written policy.The regulator served an enforcement notice on the law firm requesting itto prepare a written policy to prohibit sending legal documents that containpersonal data to an insecure fax number (that is, without encryption or to afax machine accessible to other users).Lessons learnedWhile the above case studies relate to law firms, they are common databreaches that can happen whenever confidential documents containingpersonal data or other confidential information are delivered, sent ortransmitted by organisations.The data protection law requires that organisations take adequatemeasures to safeguard and protect personal data from unauthorised access.Organisations should ensure that their employees are trained on what securitymeasures the organisation requires them to take when handling documentsthat contain personal data and other confidential information.Any third-parties entrusted with delivery should be similarly briefed.Verbal instructions or reminders are not enough.An organisation shouldhave a formal written policy in place.Always deliver or send confidential documents in a sealed envelopemarked “Confidential” and marked to be opened by the named addresseeonly.Do not include in any acknowledgement receipt any information fromwhich an unauthorised recipient can infer personal information of theintended recipient.It is risky to fax confidential documents.If they need to be faxed, a coversheet should be used.This will let anyone know who the information is forand whether it is confidential or sensitive, without them having to look at thecontents.Before faxing the document, the sender should confirm that therecipient is ready to receive it.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESWhen handling documents containing private, confidential and even sensitive information,organisations should take the following precautionary measures:■■■■Ensure there are security measures and procedures in place when confidential orsensitive documents are delivered, sent or transmitted.For example, using sealedenvelopes and acknowledgement of receipt.Ensure there are written policies and guidelines in place to ensure no sensitivedocuments are disclosed during delivery or when acknowledging receipt.Ensure all personnel including messengers and delivery service providers are trained.When faxing confidential documents, use a secure procedure, such as:••••Double-check the fax numberUse a cover sheet to shield the sensitive informationConfirm that the recipient is ready to receive the documentCall or email the recipient to confirm that the document has been sent and

rodent that is noted for its habit of collecting bright, shinyobjects and leaving other objects, such as nuts or pebbles, in their place.Individuals who store everything they acquire and won’t discard any of it andindividuals who collect things they do not need are a close human equivalent.In data protection, pack rats are particularly common in three areas:■■■job applicationsproposals for services (e.g. insurance) that are rejected by the potentialcustomer and for financial advice that are rejected by the individualseeking advicephotosMy all-time favourite pack ratsThe clear winner of my own “who’s the worst pack rat” competition is anHR manager.This HR manager’s organisation recruits for about 500 openpositions each year.They told me they keep unsuccessful job applications forfive years “because we might want to call them about another job in thefuture”.A runner-up in my competition is a public relations manager whoseorganisation provides community services, including sporting and otherevents, to teenagers.At every event they take dozens of photos.They publisha couple of them in their next newsletter and might even use a photo in theirAnnual Report.They told me they never discard any photos because “wemight want to use them in the future”.In both cases, it seems highly unlikely that even a single job applicationor photo would be used after the role had been filled or the newsletter andAnnual Report had been published.There is no point from a business perspective in retaining the personaldata in job applications and in photos for a very long time on a “just in case”basis.The downside of retaining personal dataWe’ve seen that there’s no upside – no point – in retaining personal data injob applications and photos for a very long time on a “just in case” basis.Now let’s look at the downside – how it can bite you – in doing so.And thisis all about failing to comply with the data protection law.First, the data protection law requires an organisation to dispose ofpersonal data when it is no longer necessary for a business or legal purpose.Organisations should develop and implement a data retention policy so thatdocuments containing personal data are securely shredded or deletedperiodically to comply with this data protection requirement.Second, where an organisation retains personal data it must comply withother obligations under the data protection law.It makes no sense from abusiness perspective for an organisation to burden itself with them inconnection with personal data that it does not really need to retain:■■■It may be unlikely that an individual will seek access to personal data inan old job application, proposal or photo.Nevertheless they have theright to do so and an organisation must have processes in place torespond to any such request.And the process will need to extend even topersonal data that the organisation retains on a “just in case” basis.The same point applies to the right of an individual to obtain informationabout how an organisation has used their personal data in the previous 12months.Again, an organisation may receive requests (and incur theadministrative burden of dealing with them) in connection with personaldata that serves no useful purpose for the organisation, except for any“just in case” benefit.The same points apply to the right of an individual to correct any error oromission in the personal data that an organisation holds about them.A disgruntled, unsuccessful job or insurance applicant might make theserequests simply to cause administrative hassles.They may delight in the ideathat the organisation has to go back through its records to find their personaldata so that it can respond to the request.They could then report to theregulator that the organisation retained their personal data when it was nolonger necessary for a business or legal purpose.In addition, the data protection legislation requires an organisation toprotect the personal data in its possession or under its control.It makes nosense to retain personal data “just in case” it is required and thereby assumethe obligation to protect it.Much better to cease to retain personal data whenit’s no longer necessary for a legal or business purpose than to worry abouthow to protect it.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should put in place safeguards to protect the personal and confidentialdocuments in their possession or under their control:■■■Implement reasonable security measures and controls.Develop and implement a data protection policy and comply with it.Implement processes to enable individuals to exercise their access and correction rightsto their personal data.62",,," Who was responsible for the privacy breach?

118,118,USB drive or other portable storage device,"The data protection law requires organisations, which includes individuals,to protect personal data in their possession or under their control.Any failuremight result in a data breach with consequences under the data protectionlaw.But any failure might also result in loss of confidential information,including competitively sensitive information.If you have a USB drive or other portable storage device and you use itfor office or business purposes, you run the risk of a data breach under thedata protection law.If you use it only for personal purposes, you run the riskof personal embarrassment or worse.If you use the same device for businessand personal purposes – perhaps you should stop doing so.For a mobile salesperson such as a real estate agent or a financialadviser or other individual who is generally “on the road”, you areparticularly exposed as you may easily lose your USB or other portablestorage device.High probability that your storage device could be misplaced or lostHave you ever forgotten to take your portable storage device out of yourpocket before putting your clothes in the washing machine or sending them tothe dry cleaners?Or have you forgotten to remove it after using a public orother shared computer terminal?Or have you ever lost a portable storagedevice and concluded that it must have fallen out of your pocket in a taxi?Surveys by Credant Technologies, a London-based data securitycompany, have revealed that:■■At more than 500 laundromats and dry cleaners in the UK, 17,000 USBdrives were left behind between December 2010 and January 2011.Thiswas a 400% increase in lost devices compared to the year before.1In 2011, travellers left behind 8,016 mobile devices at seven of thelargest airports in the United States.This figure comprised smartphonesand tablets (43%), laptops (45%) and USB drives (12%).2Data from Transport for London (TfL) has revealed that Londoners leftalmost 25,000 devices such as phones, laptops and USB sticks on buses,taxis and tube trains in 2013.3You might fail to comply with the data protection lawIf you lose a portable storage device, the loss may, depending on thecircumstances, result in a data breach that is a failure to comply with the dataprotection law.Protecting personal data on a portable storage device by a strongpassword and/or by encryption should prevent an individual who finds thedevice and happens to have malicious intent from getting access to thepersonal data on it and using it.An organisation that fails to comply with the data protection law may befined or face other penalties if they suffer a data breach as a result ofsomeone accessing and using personal data on a portable storage device usedby an employee of the organisation.For example, a local government authority was fined £80,000 after aspecial education needs4 teacher lost a USB stick which held personal andsensitive data of children with special educational needs.The USB stick wasunencrypted and the regulator decided that “Personal data and sensitivepersonal data were lost due to the inappropriate technical and administrativemeasures taken by the data controller”.In another case,5 the regulator fined a US Government Department$150,000 for privacy and security breaches when an employee lost anunencrypted USB drive. (It was stolen from the employee’s vehicle.)Itcontained the health information of 2,200 people.The regulator also requiredthe organisation to develop and implement a corrective action plan.It wasrequired to include a risk analysis and a risk management plan to address andmitigate any security risks and vulnerabilities.Questions about your USB drive and other portable storage devices■■■■■Do you protect your USB drive and other portable storage devices by astrong password and by encryption?Do you minimise the risk of a data breach by deleting from your USBdrive and other portable storage devices any documents containingpersonal data or other confidential information when they are no longerneeded?Do you ensure that you keep your USB drive and other portable storagedevices safely?Do you make sure that you account for your USB drive and other portablestorage devices at all times?Do you regularly scan your USB drive and other portable storage devicesfor viruses and malware?If the answer to any of these questions is “no” you should take remedialaction.Protect your devices and their contents with strong passwords andencryptionEncryption can be done at either the device level – that is, every file on thedevice is, in effect, encrypted – or it can be done on a file-by-file basis.It is easy to encrypt devices.Bundled utility programs for doing so areincluded in popular computer operating systems or can be purchasedseparately.Information about how to find and use them is readily availableon the Internet.These applications can also encrypt the entire hard disk ofyour computer.They work in the same way as for your portable storagedevices.If you decide not to encrypt at the device level, then you should at leastpassword-protect the device or the specific documents that contain personaldata or other confidential information.Delete any sensitive documents containing personal data when no longerneededThe data protection law requires organisations to dispose of personal datawhen it is no longer necessary for a business or legal purpose.An alternativeis to anonymise it (which is not as straightforward as it seems).The requirement applies to personal data on USB drives and otherportable storage devices in the same way as it applies to personal data in anorganisation’s IT system or stored locally on computer hard disks.An organisation’s Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policy shouldrequire employees to delete documents containing personal data or otherconfidential information from their USB drives and other portable storagedevices, as well as from their phones, tablets and any other mobile devices.Because USB drives and other portable storage devices are at risk ofloss, an organisation should require its employees to delete personal dataand other confidential information from them when it no longer needs toreside on them – for example, after it has been transferred to theorganisation’s IT system and the employee no longer needs it “on the road”.Secure your USB drive and other portable storage devicesKeep your USB drive and other portable storage devices safe and secure.Donot leave them unattended or unsecured when they are stored – whether it isat home, in your room or at your work desk.Know where your devices are and keep an inventorySo how many storage devices do you have altogether?Where are they?Haveyou misplaced any of them or loaned any of them to family, friends orcolleagues?What’s in those devices?Scan your USB drive and other portable storage devices for viruses andmalwareUSB storage devices have become so popular that cyber criminals havewritten viruses and worms that specifically target them.If, for example,someone plugs an infected USB drive into your home computer, thesecriminals could inadvertently upload the bug and potentially cripple themachine.If you use the same device in your organisation, the malware can connectto the office network and upload the worm to replicate itself on the network,putting it and everyone at risk.Therefore, you should regularly scan any USB drive or other portablestorage device for viruses and malware.And don’t forget to ensure that yourscanning program has the latest updates.Final words of cautionEven if you have the precautionary measures in place, it is best if you avoidstoring sensitive personal data, such as identity card numbers and credit cardnumbers, and other confidential personal data on a USB drive or otherportable storage device.I once met a property agent who panicked because they’d lost a USBdrive which was not protected at all.For whatever reason, the property agenthad stored all their tenancy agreements on it.And didn’t have a back-upcopy.Do not use the same USB drives for home and work to avoid accidentallyintroducing a virus you picked up from an infected device into yourcompany’s office network. (Or vice versa!)And be sure to find out about policies adopted by your organisation aboutwhat external devices can be plugged into its network.Failing to complywith them generally has disciplinary consequences up to and includingtermination of employment.Using a USB drive or other portable storage device is just one of manyways a data breach can happen to you or your organisation.You should beaware of the risks and how to manage them, especially if you are a mobilewarrior.The “enemy” is lurking quietly everywhere, waiting to pounce onyou when you least expect it.The data protection law also changes the rulesof the game.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and individuals should take due care to protect and secure USB drives andother portable storage devices:■■■■■■Protect your devices and their contents with strong passwords and encryption.Delete any sensitive documents containing personal data when no longer needed.Do not leave storage devices unattended or unsecured when they are stored – whether itis at home, in your room or at your work desk.Know where your devices are and keep an inventory.Scan your USB drive and other portable storage devices for viruses and malware.Regularly conduct a risk assessment exercise to address and mitigate any securityrisks.12345See http://blog.allusb.com/2011/03/rising-trend-in-lost-usb-flash-drives/See http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120703005106/en/Credant-Survey-Finds-Travelers-Left-8000-MobileSee http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2384295/londoners-left-21-000-phones-in-buses-tubes-and-taxis-in-2013See http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2013/October/lost-unencrypted-usb-stick-costs-council-80000-data-breach-fine/See http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/lost-thumb-drive-leads-150k-fine 63",,," What does the data protection law require?

125,125,freelancers,"First things first.By “freelancer” I mean individuals who are self-employedand not necessarily committed to a particular employer.In some countriesthey might be called “independent contractors” rather than freelancers.It’sthe same thing.At the end of 2014 I conducted a series of data protection law trainingsessions for more than 50 freelance travel guides engaged by a travel agency.The agency wanted to ensure that all its travel agents comply with the dataprotection law.I asked them how many of them were aware that it existed inthe first place – the data protection rules in it had been in force in Singaporefor about six months.Only one person was aware of its existence. (And this person happenedto be a property agent.This is not uncommon as freelancers take on multiplejobs.)So, more than 90% of the course participants were totally unaware of thedata protection law.And so they were equally unaware that it governs howthey collect, use, disclose and care for individuals’ personal data in theirpossession.And that if they fail to comply with it, they may incur penalties,including fines.Freelancers are considered organisationsWe find that when individuals are employees of an organisation they have nodifficulty with the concept that the data protection law applies to theorganisation.They may not like it, but when they know that there is a dataprotection law, they understand that the organisation that employs them mustcomply with it.Even when they know about the data protection law, we typically findthat individuals who are self-employed, including freelancers, do not thinkthat it applies to them, especially if they have not set themselves up as acompany or other registered business.They are wrong.The rules about when the data protection law applies can becomplicated, but here’s a rule of thumb in connection with individuals:■■If an individual is collecting, using or disclosing personal data in apersonal or domestic capacity, the data protection law does not apply.Soit does not apply to individuals swapping personal data such as contactdetails to arrange a party or to start a book club that will meet at theirhouse or to invite guests to their child’s wedding.If an individual is collecting, using or disclosing personal data for abusiness purpose or in a business context, then the data protection lawdoes apply.If the individual is an employee of an organisation, it is theorganisation that must comply with it.If the individual is not anemployee, the individual is considered to be an “organisation” and mustcomply with the data protection law.Hence, whether you are freelancing as a tour guide, a financial adviser, aproperty agent, a consultant, a tutor, a multi-level marketing salesperson oran individual involved in making money part-time, the data protection lawapplies to you.Failure to comply with the data protection law can result in penalties,including hefty fines.Individuals can file a complaint with the regulator and,in some jurisdictions, even sue the freelancer to get compensation for anyloss to them from the freelancer failing to comply with the data protectionlaw.Common data protection law exposures for freelancersHere are some things done by tour guides which can get them into troubleunder the data protection law – they apply equally to other freelancers with atweak of the context:■■In situations where they handle a lot of personal data, making mistakes(such as mixing up personal data of different individuals or writing itdown incorrectly) or accidentally disclosing personal data to someonewho is not authorised to see it – for example, when helping individuals tocheck in and check out of hotels or to join a sightseeing tourCarelessly repeating individual’s credit card numbers when booking theirtours – this includes calling them out in front of other members of the■■■■group or talking about them over the phone when they can be overheardGossiping about individuals, such as members of a tour group that theysuspect are having a secret romance (or who are having a less thansecret, but illicit, romance!)Writing credit card numbers down in the travel itinerary list or on scrapsof paper that can be seen by unauthorised individuals or lostLosing personal data about individuals, such as guest travel listscontaining their travel itinerary and their rooming informationFailing to dispose of personal data about individuals after their travelguide assignment is done, or disposing of it but failing to do so securelyData protection law obligations for freelancersMost freelancers process personal data on behalf of the organisations thathire them to provide their services.They should always make sure that theyhave a contract in writing with the organisation that hires them because thismay reduce their liabilities under the data protection law.Typically, the organisation will be liable under the data protection lawfor what the freelancers do (or don’t do) too.This is the reason whyorganisations should require freelancers to sign a contract that includes anundertaking to comply with the data protection law.Some organisations alsorequire the freelancer to indemnify the organisation against the monetaryconsequences to the organisation of the freelancer failing to comply with thedata protection law.In Singapore’s case, the data intermediary need only comply with twoobligations – the protection obligation and the retention limitation obligation– if they have a contract in writing (or evidenced in writing).In any event, a freelancer that processes personal data on behalf of anorganisation will have at least two obligations under the data protection law.Obligation to dispose of personal dataThe freelancer must dispose of the personal data (or anonymise it1) when it isno longer necessary for the freelancer to retain it for a business or legalpurpose.Depending on the terms of their contract with the travel agency, afreelancer who is a tour guide might need to keep it for a few months in caseof any disputes.Otherwise, the freelancer may only need to retain thepersonal data for a very short time after each separate tour engagement.The point is that the tour guide should take care not to forget to dispose ofpersonal data when they no longer need it.Retaining it exposes them tounnecessary risks, especially if the documents containing the personal dataare stored unsecured at home.This is because they have to protect thepersonal data for as long as they retain it.Obligation to protect personal dataThe freelancer must protect the personal data that they collect for and onbehalf of the organisation (if the freelancer is an insurance agent, forexample) or the personal data that they receive from the organisation (if thefreelancer is a tour guide, for example).In one of my engagements, I was told about a case where a tour guideabsent-mindedly left a clear folder of the entire list of his guests containingpersonal data and hotel-rooming information at a Starbucks, only forsomeone to call the agency to return it.Imagine what would have happened ifthat person called to complain to the regulator?Use of personal dataWhen an organisation collects personal data from individuals they do so forspecified purposes – in the case of a travel agency, for the purpose ofproviding travel services to them.Freelancers should bear in mind that when the travel agency passes thepersonal data on to them they may use it only for the purpose that the travelagency specifies (which the travel agency must ensure is within the scope ofthe consent that the individual gave them).All of this is a long way of sayingthat freelancers are not permitted by the data protection law to use thepersonal data passed to them by a travel agency for any other purpose.Ofcourse they are not permitted to use it for personal gain.The bottom line for freelancersPutting the above three things together, it is obvious that a freelancer shoulddispose of personal data as soon as they no longer need it for a businesspurpose.There is no upside in keeping it for a longer time because:■■they must protect it for as long as they retain it andthey must not use it.Did I waste my breath training the tour guides?Here is what happened when I ended my session with the tour guides.One ofthem innocently came to me and asked:“You know, I enjoyed your session.I have a question.Can I revealmy clients’ names to my friends so that my friends can claim freeparking at the hotel where my clients are staying?”What part of “you must protect personal data and not disclose it for anypurpose except providing your tour guide services” did they not understand?CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations that hire freelancers should ensure that the freelancers comply with the dataprotection law when they process personal data on behalf of the organisation:■■Make sure that there is a written contract with your organisation.This may reduce yourliabilities under the data protection law.Make sure that freelancers understand and carry out their obligations under the dataprotection law:••••Protect the personal data collected for and on behalf of your organisation.Do not use the personal data for any other secondary purposes, other than thosewhere consent has been given.Dispose of the personal data (or anonymise it) when it is no longer necessary to retainit for a business or legal purpose.Securely dispose of or shred unwanted documents containing personal data.1Refer to chapter 28, “Anonymising personal data … but is the individual really notidentifiable?”67",,," How many freelance travel guides did I conduct at the end of 2014?

126,126,Beware when connecting to public WiFi –,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
127,127,don’t trust the postman!,"Do you sometimes or often use public WiFi to connect to the Internet?Many of us do this to save on the limited data plan that we subscribe tothrough our telecommunications provider.So we will not hesitate to connectto WiFi networks in places where we can get free Internet access.Placeswhere we sit to chat and work such as McDonald’s and Starbucks and placesthat we visit such as shopping centres.And even in convention centreballrooms and meeting rooms when checking our email is more divertingthan paying attention to our purpose in being there.And some of us simply seize any opportunity to connect to any opennetwork just to get free online access.Did you know?Did you know that it is possible to access the personal data of every person(at a certain place) who is connected to a public WiFi at any particular time?Here’s how.Hackers go to a public place and create a fake – or maybe“unofficial” would be a better description – hotspot network.Otherindividuals at that place connect to the hotspot network so that they get freeonline access.Then the hacker intercepts their connections.By using certaintools, like a WiFi sniffer or analyser1, the hacker spies on the data sent to andfrom the devices of individuals who connected to the hotspot network.In sodoing, the hacker can collect user names, passwords, email addresses, hotelswhere someone is staying, etc.For example, an Android application called DroidSheep looks for andlists any unsecure log-ins to popular websites.While it doesn’t capture thepasswords to those sites, it can exploit a vulnerability that allows you toopen the site using another person’s current session, giving you full access totheir account in the process.Now imagine the types of places where a hacker might find particularlyvaluable data.For example, a café in a financial district where employees offinancial institutions connect to the hacker’s hotspot network.Or at crowdedconferences where participants are keen to log in to any free WiFi offered bythe conference organisers (just to catch up on unfinished work), whichunderstandably becomes congested.It would be relatively easy to set up analternative WiFi name such as “Conference X - 2” to fool individuals intoconnecting to the wireless network and then siphoning the Internet traffic toeavesdrop and steal personal data.A “man-in-the-middle attack”So, having intercepted the connections of an individual who logs in to apublic WiFi network, what does the hacker do next?Well, the problem with most WiFi networks is that when data is sent – forexample, an email – it is not encrypted, allowing what is called a “man-in-the-middle attack”.This is the vulnerability that the hacker exploits.Here is the parallel in the physical world.Imagine you’re mailing aletter.You put that letter in your mailbox and then the postman picks up theletter and delivers it to the addressee.A man-in-the-middle attack is when anunauthorised person, not employed by the post office, intercepts the letterbefore the mailman arrives to pick it up.This person could read the letter andeven make changes to its contents before putting it back into the mailbox.Important checklist■■■■■Do you ensure that you do not log in to any open (unsecured) WiFinetwork?When you log in to WiFi, is it always a source you trust and is theconnection encrypted?Do you refrain from processing personal data or other confidentialinformation (such as banking transactions) on an open WiFi network?When you tether or use your own hotspot, is your device alwayspassword-protected?Do you ensure that you do not broadcast your full identity on your WiFiand Bluetooth connection?If your answer to any of the above is “no”, please read on to learn what youshould be doing.Refrain from logging into public WiFiYou should not connect to any open public WiFi network.Ensure yourcomputer or mobile device is not set up to connect automatically to

organisation’s WiFi is one example of a trusted source or provider ofInternet access.When logging into public WiFi services of reputablecompanies, for example at the airport, you will often be authenticated interms of a passcode being sent to you via SMS or there could be a WiFipasscode you must first enter.Ensure that the connection is encrypted bylooking for a “lock” icon beside the WiFi connection.If the connection is notencrypted, refrain from performing any sensitive transactions such as onlinebanking.If your organisation provides a VPN (virtual private network) service,ensure you use it.This is because VPN services always encrypt data sentthrough them.Anyone trying to steal your data will see only encrypted datathat they can’t decipher.If a VPN service is not available to you, you can useVPN services (such as Witopia.net and StrongVPN.com) which charge a feefor their use on a daily or annual subscription basis.Refrain from processing personal data or other confidential on an openpublic WiFi networkIf you really cannot avoid using an open public network you should ensurethat the particular website you want to log on to is secure.In the address barof your browser window, look for the “https” at the beginning of the webaddress (or, on some web browsers, a lock icon).Another alternative is to use your smartphone as a hotspot or do thetransactions on your mobile device,

128,128,"Digitising may be efficient, but don’t","forget the hardcopyIt almost goes without saying that office space is expensive, especially well-located office space in cities.It equally goes without saying that mostorganisations reduce their overhead expenses as much as possible by limitingthe office space they acquire.It then follows that they find ways and means tomaximise its use.Besides carving out space for people, furniture and equipment, officeplanners have to create storage areas for paper documents and files.Onemeans of reducing physical storage space is to digitise the paper documentsand store them in computer servers or magnetic media that take up a fractionof the space.Besides the saving in storage space, digitisation brings about a number ofefficiencies and benefits.For example:■■■■the same e-document can be shared with a number of users concurrentlyat any time and at any placeit is easier to index and retrieve e-documentsan organisation can implement secure access controls to e-documents ande-documents do not deteriorate over time.Far from paperless office environmentOrganisations may dream of a paperless – or at least a “less-paper” – officeenvironment.However, even with digitisation, many organisations stillmaintain lots of compactus filing systems and storage cabinets for paperdocuments.Why is this so?In some instances and due to legal or statutory requirements, originalpaper documents bearing original authorised signatures, seals or companystamps must be maintained.It makes no difference that digital versions havebeen created.Examples of such documents include certificates and licencesand, in some cases, even contracts and more informal documents such asmemoranda of understanding.What should organisations do?Organisations are faced with having two systems to manage their valuableand confidential documents – one for paper documents and one for e-documents.For e-documents, there are a number of proven document managementsystems in the market.Some of them even include an authentication functionso that e-documents can be produced in court in lieu of producing an original(paper) document.Managing paper documents is more challenging, particularly where anorganisation adopts digitisation, as it involves a number of manualprocesses.Here are some tips:■Version controlThe paper version of each document and any e-version of it must beconsistent.This is obviously easy where the organisation creates thedocument electronically.Whenever there is a new version of a paperdocument, either created by the organisation (such as by having anindividual complete a paper form) or received from a third-party, adigitised version should be created as soon as possible.■Indexing and cataloguingPaper documents have to be indexed and catalogued in a file inventory sothat the organisation knows at any time where these documents are kept.The file inventory also helps the organisation to retrieve anydocument efficiently when needed.This is important in enabling anorganisation to comply with the access and correction requirements of thedata protection law.It is usually necessary in enabling it to comply withits document retention policy, as required by the data protection law.■Access controlThe organisation must develop and implement policies to classifydocuments (such as “Confidential”, “Public”) and to control access topersonal data and other confidential information on a “need to know”basis among its employees.This too is an important element in enabling an organisation to complywith the data protection law.■Retention and storageThe paper documents have to be stored in a safe and secure place toenable an organisation to comply with requirements of the data protectionlaw to protect personal data.The storage place should have appropriateenvironmental controls to prevent the deterioration of the paper.If the paper documents are stored offsite, such as in a warehouse, theorganisation should first satisfy itself that the warehouse operator iscapable of storing the documents safely and securely.The organisationshould include requirements in its contract with the warehouse operatorabout safety and security of storage and audit, particularly wheredocuments contain sensitive personal data or highly confidentialinformation.The organisation should ensure that the warehouse operatorabides by these stringent requirements, including by exercising anyinspection or audit rights under the contract.The time period of storage should follow the organisation’s documentretention policy for each type of document.■Disposal and destructionThe paper documents that contain personal data have to be marked forsecure disposal or destruction when the retention periods adopted forcompliance with the data protection law are reached.The retention schedule for each such document has to be recorded inthe file inventory to ensure efficient tracking of the life of the document.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIn managing paper documents, organisations should adopt the following practices:■■■■■Version control – consistency between the versions of paper documents and e-documents.Indexing and cataloguing – file inventory to help in organising and storing the paperdocuments and in retrieving them when needed.Access control – policy to spell out who can have access to what document.Retention and storage – safe and secure place for storing paper documents, preferablywith environmental controls.Same requirements apply to paper documents that arestored offsite at warehouses.Disposal and destruction – secure disposal or destruction of the paper documents whenthe retention periods are reached.71",,," What is one way to reduce physical storage space?

129,129,cyber theft? Think again!,"In May 2015, a journalist wrote in The Straits Times in Singapore that shewas a victim of cyber thieves.They stole the ID and password of her Gmailaccount.They also grabbed her list of contacts and their email details.How could this have happened to a veteran journalist who is pretty tech-savvy and has written dozens of IT-related articles?Simple: she was avictim of phishing.It can happen to anyone.What is phishing?Phishing is a type of cyber theft – a type of cyber attack.Wikipedia definesphishing as the illegal attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly,money), often for malicious reasons, by masquerading as a trustworthy entityin an electronic communication.A sub-set of phishing is spear phishing.In a phishing attack, individualsreceive emails more or less indiscriminately.In a spear phishing attack,specific individuals (usually within the same organisation) are targeted in aneffort to find a way into that organisation’s IT system.How phishing happened to the journalistHere is how the journalist described what happened to her:It happened so swiftly.I was browsing through my Gmail accounton my iPad when I came across an e-mail supposedly from adot.com entrepreneur I have known for 20 years.I opened the e-mail and it had a link to a document I was supposed to downloadfrom his Google Drive account.It was nothing extraordinarybecause Google Drive is a digital cabinet into which Gmail usersput documents they want to share.Since I thought I knew thesender, I proceeded to download the document by keying in myGmail ID and password.The same prompt appeared again, askingfor my ID and password.Thinking I had made a mistake the firsttime, I typed my details again.And that was my mistake .The second time round, the hacker had directed me to a newwebsite from which he could grab my credentials and gain accessto everything in my Gmail account .It is scary to think that we can be fooled easily by the contents in an email.But many of us would react in exactly the same way as the journalist whenwe receive an email that is apparently from someone we know and theirrequest is something that we expect to get from them.Why organisations should be concerned about phishingOrganisations should be concerned about their employees falling victim tophishing.Intruders can enter the organisation’s IT system through a phishingattack and steal confidential information, for example.They can also stealpersonal data.The data protection law requires an organisation to implementreasonable measures to protect personal data.So any theft of personal data – that is, a data breach – may mean that theorganisation has failed to comply with the data protection law.The regulatormight find that the organisation has not implemented reasonable measures toprotect its back-end IT infrastructure, for example.What organisations should doEven if an organisation has the most advanced IT protection measures andsystems in place, phishing can still succeed and do harm because of an actionby an unwitting or negligent employee.It is therefore important for an organisation to educate its employeesabout phishing.This includes ensuring employees are aware of phishing, arefamiliar with common phishing methods and have been trained to avoidfalling prey to it.Examples of phishing methodsThe journalist’s email was from someone she thought she knew, through anapproach called social engineering.Social engineering is the art ofmanipulating people so they give up confidential information.Here are some more everyday examples of emails and websites that candeceive almost anyone, especially in the right context or coming fromsomeone you know.■Email from a bankBanks generally say that they will never send an email concerning bankaccount details and ask you to log in to it or to do something inconnection with it.So if you receive an email that is apparently from your bank, tellingyou, for example, that your account will be suspended or deactivated ifyou do not do something, you should never do it.The “something” isusually asking you to click on a link.If you do so, the phishing attack maysucceed and the sender gains access to your IT system.Simply delete theemail.If you are concerned that it might be genuine and that you should not■■ignore it, call your bank to check with them about whether they sent theemail.Or, if you have online access to your bank account, go to thebank’s website and log in to your account and check for any messages thebank may have sent to you securely.Email from your organisation’s IT administratorIf you get an email that is apparently from, say, your IT administrator(such as “You have exceeded the storage limit on your mailbox”), or evenfrom your boss asking you to click a link to perform some action, youshould be suspicious about it immediately.Call the sender and checkwhether the email is genuine.Never click on the link without checking.Email alertsAnother common phishing method is an email that alerts you tosomething, such as the status of your account with an organisation or, anold favourite, the progress in delivery of a parcel to you.These veryoften look genuine and may appear to come from organisations withwhich you have a customer relationship.You should never click on any link in them without checking that theyare genuine.Resist the temptation to check on the progress of a parcelwhen you were not expecting to receive any parcel.Indeed, even if by■chance you are expecting a parcel when you receive one of these emailsyou likely do not need to know the progress of it.You should not click onthe link.Emails from someone you knowI need not remind you that receiving an email that is apparently fromsomeone you know is the approach to which the journalist fell victim.Be immediately suspicious of a message such as “Click here for theinformation we discussed” or “The information you requested isattached”.Yes, links are risks but some phishing attacks occur throughopening an attachment to an email.So be suspicious immediately whenyou receive an email with an attachment.Think about whether you were expecting to receive something fromthe apparent sender.If so, think about whether what the email says iswhat you’d expect them to say.In case of any doubt, call the apparentsender and check whether they sent the email.Sober statisticsIn its 2015 Data Breach Investigation Report1, Verizon Communications Inc.found that more than two-thirds of the 290 electronic espionage cases itlearned about in 2014 involved phishing.The bad news is that Verizon foundthat sending phishing emails to just 10 employees will get hackers insidecorporate gates 90% of the time.A Symantec Intelligence Report issued in February 20152 reported thatthe most common attachment in phishing is a .doc file.The .txt file type camein second. (So beware of clicking on email attachments.)The report said thathackers prefer to target organisations with between one and 250 employees.It said that finance, insurance and real estate are the top industries targeted inspear phishing attacks.Tips on how to prevent phishingHere are some ways to inspect an email to see if it is likely to be genuine:■Tip #1 : Check to see the source of the email.Don’t just read the header – look at the email address to determine theauthenticity.Ensure that the email source is valid.For example, if anemail is sent from Apple, check to see if the email address is really fromApple, e.g. yourcontact@apple.com.■Tip #2 : Beware if the email looks anything like spam email.For example, look at whether the email is poorly written, meaning that■it has poor wording and grammar.Look at the greeting message.Besuspicious if it is a generic non-personalised greeting.Or if it is not thekind of email you would expect to receive from the apparent sender –where, for example, someone you know only in a social context appearsto be sending you an email related to business with them or wheresomeone you have not been in contact with for a long time suddenly sendsyou an email with an attachment or asks you to click on a link.Tip #3 : If the email asks you to click on a URL link, check the source ofthe link.You can check the source of the link by hovering your mouse over the■link.Its source will appear.It is not genuine if the website or domainname does not reflect the identity of the organisation or person apparentlycontacting you.Tip #4 : Beware if there is an unexpected attachment to the email or if anattachment is a zipped file.As mentioned above, be wary if an attachment to an email seems to be■out of context.Be careful about all attachments to emails, but beextremely careful if the attachment is a zipped file.Zipped files havegenuine uses of course, but they are often used to install malicious codeon your computer or mobile device.Tip #5 : Except where you have no doubt that the email is genuine, youshould always verify the identity or the source of the email.For example,you could contact the sender by phone.As a golden rule, DO NOT click on any download links or emailattachments without first checking these 5 tips.Prevention is better than cureIf you or any of the employees in your organisation get tricked by a phishingattack, the consequences can be pretty nasty, especially when it comes topersonal data that you hold.The root cause of many large data breaches can be traced to someonewho fell victim to spear phishing.3 This is because the spear phisher knowssomething about the targeted individual – for example, that they are in theorganisation’s IT Department and have “privileged access” to its IT system.Phishers thrive on stealing credit card details, bank account numbers,passwords or financial related information.As the journalist put it: “When Ifound out, I felt no different than if I’d been told that someone had broken intomy home, rifled through my correspondence and taken the names, addressesand telephone numbers of my family members, friends and work contacts.Itsent a chill down my spine.”A call to actionStop cyber thieves from breaking into your virtual home or office.Get youremployees trained now.In addition to training them not to open emailattachments and not to click on download links that they are not expecting,other precautions include the following:■■■Always run the latest version of security software.Run regular full scans on computers and mobile devices and regularlyback-up files.Use strong passwords and change them regularly.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and individuals should adopt the following practices to prevent phishing:■■■■■■■When inspecting an email and in doubt, check to see the source of the email.Beware if the email looks anything like spam email.If the email asks you to click on a URL link, check the source of the link firstBeware if there is an unexpected attachment to the email or if the attachment is a zippedfile.Verify the identity or the source of the email when in doubt.For example, you couldcontact the sender by phone.Do not click on any download links or email attachments.Ensure employees are trained in basic information security and that they comply with therelevant policies.123http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigation-report-2015-insider_en_xg.pdf#sthash.qtIsfxaB.dpufhttp://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-intelligence-report-02-2015-en-us.pdfRefer to chapter 71, “Don’t be social engineered!”73",,," What is spear phishing?

131,131,in the dump?,"“Is that your name, address, phone number in the dump?”was the title of anarticle in The Sunday Times in Singapore in May 2015.The article discusseda data breach involving paper documents that had been discarded togetherwith general office rubbish.The data breach happened in the central business district.A reporter sawdocuments containing personal data in the rubbish from offices in high-risecommercial buildings.The documents were in a dumpster in a publiclaneway, visible to any individual walking down the lane.They were markedas “Confidential” or “Strictly Confidential” and belonged to variousorganisations, including a bank, a law firm and a real estate company.The documents included photocopies of passports, résumés of variousprofessionals and details of commissions paid to property agents as well asprintouts of emails with addresses, names and telephone numbers.Therewere also documents of a law firm’s business expansion plan, with personaldetails of lawyers it hoped to get on board, including their photographs,educational background and work history.The incident involved organisations we trust with our personal data.Yetit happened.The irony is that these organisations – especially the bank andlaw firm – would have the strictest form of governance, risk management andcompliance.The issue here is one of operational compliance.Theiremployees may not have been trained adequately to comply with the dataprotection law, or operational aspects of compliance may have beenoverlooked.The possible root causes of the data breachSo how did the personal data end up in the dump?We can only speculate, ofcourse.But we do know that the documents containing personal data andother confidential information were not shredded.Why not?One likely answer is that the documents were simply thrown intowastepaper baskets in the office.Then the cleaners emptied them and thedocuments thus found their way to the dumpster.Any paper documentcontaining personal data or other confidential information should always besecurely destroyed, such as by shredding.Another possibility is that there were paper shredders in the respectiveoffices, but not all documents were shredded due to lack of time, laziness orpure inconvenience.■■Perhaps the shredder is not a heavy-duty unit, so only 20 sheets of papercan be shredded at once without jamming the machine.So busyemployees don’t have time to shred large documents.Perhaps employees had cleared out old files, but had to first removesheets of paper from files or folders because the shredder is not a heavy-duty unit.That takes up time and effort.Doing shredding during office time may also be disruptive because of thenoise generated from the unit.So it is left until after hours and doesn’t getdone at all.For all these reasons and more, when we do data protection audits forour clients, we often find lots of paper piled up by employees near theshredders, where someone else – presumably a more junior employee – isexpected to do the shredding.And it is not their priority!A few more factors to take into accountThe recycling bin within an organisation’s office is another potential sourceof data breaches.In wanting to “Go Green”, many organisations advocaterecycling.Unfortunately, recycling paper is rarely a good idea for an organisationthat has documents containing personal data and other confidentialinformation.Beware of discarded or imperfect photocopied documents that are“recycled” by being placed back into the copier tray where they are thenforgotten.A newly copied document, which may not contain personal data orother confidential information, is then distributed along with the previouspersonal data or other confidential information on the other side.This can cause double-trouble – two data breaches.First, the personaldata or other confidential information on the back of the sheet of paper maybe viewed by employees who are not authorised to see it.Second, they maythrow the paper into the wastepaper basket because the side that they readdoes not contain personal data or other confidential information and it endsup in the dump.Finally, organisations should ensure that when they are moving offices orsending documents to be digitised, appropriate security measures are put inplace to ensure documents do not end up in the dump.At the end of the dayA few, if not all, of the possible root causes and other factors listed abovelikely contributed to personal data being found in the dump where it could beeasily accessible to anyone.According to the report:“Access to the rubbish bins was easy.One karung guni man [rag-and-bone man], who was seen sorting out the documents into neat piles,said he would sell them to recycling companies.”So organisations are exposed to failures to comply with the data protectionlaw when this happens.If documents are not disposed of securely, theorganisations have no control over where they finally end up or how thepersonal data and other confidential information in them could be used.Organisations should consider having a “shred all” policy rather thenlimiting their shredding to documents that contain personal data or otherconfidential information.That way, they need not worry about employeeshaving to decide which documents should be shredded.In any event,organisations should audit employees’ compliance to their shreddingrequirements to gain assurance that it is carried out.Otherwise, organisations should consider the benefits in productivity andcompliance with the data protection law in engaging a commercial securepaper shredding service that provides a document destruction certificate asproof of destruction.Some examples of data breaches involving paper documents■■■A local government authority in the UK was fined £250,0001 afteremployee records were found in a supermarket car park recycle bin.Ithad outsourced its digitising and had handed large volumes ofconfidential information to a service provider without performingsufficient checks on how securely the information would be kept andwithout even putting a contract in place.The regulator required a property management company to sign anundertaking2 to comply with a data protection principle following theloss of 37 employees’ details when a filing cabinet was sent to arecycling centre and crushed.A restaurant in Hong Kong photocopied a chef’s identity card but madetwo copies due to a copier malfunction.It recycled the second copy byputting it back into the photocopier tray.Later, it photocopied a menu onthe back of that second copy and used the menu to record customers’orders.The chef complained to the regulator3, which then recommendedthat the restaurant formulate an internal policy on the handling ofemployees’ personal data (especially identity card copies), and ensurethat the relevant staff were trained.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should adopt the following practices in disposing of unwanted paperscontaining personal data or other confidential information:■■■■■■■Mark confidential documents, especially those containing personal data, as“Confidential”.Train employees not to dispose of documents containing personal information into therubbish bins.When shredding documents with personal information, ensure that they are shreddedimmediately, instead of piling them beside the shredder.When doing recycling, ensure no documents containing personal information arerecycled or thrown into the bin.Adopt a “shred all” policy, especially if the organisation is in the business of processingpersonal data.Engage a secure paper shredding service to shred documents containing personalinformation.When moving office or sending personal information for digitising, ensure the propersecurity measures are taken to avoid data leakage or exposure.123ICO press release “Council fined £250,000 after employee records found in supermarketcar park recycle bin”, 11 Sep 2002.ICO

132,132,Whatever happened to your unwanted,"computers and portable devices?When organisations are done using paper documents and files containingpersonal data or other confidential information, they can tear them, shredthem, burn them, archive them or store them in warehouses.But what aboutcomputers and portable devices containing personal data or otherconfidential information that are longer wanted or needed?■■■■■Here are some possibilities:Stack them in the server room, in the IT Department or in a storeroom.They can be used as spares or as standby equipment for temporary staff.Sell them to commercial companies that trade in used hardware.Donate them to charities for them to use or to give to the needy.Discard them by throwing them into the rubbish bins or e-waste disposalbins.Engage recycling companies to cart them away for recycling.If not done carefully – including with compliance with the data protectionlaw in mind – all of these actions may result in the organisation disclosingpersonal data and other confidential information to individuals who are notauthorised to see it.They may also result in the organisation failing tocomply with other requirements under the data protection law, depending onthe circumstances.Here we set out some things that organisations should at least do withunwanted computers and portable devices to guard against a data breach.Securely delete personal data and other confidential information incomputersWhatever means are used to keep, transfer ownership of or discard unwantedcomputers and portable devices, organisations should make sure that no data,especially personal data and other confidential information, remains in theirhard disks.Erasing or deleting electronic files using computer software is not goodenough.Images of these files still remain in the hard disks until they areoverwritten by new data, but there is no guarantee that all copies of the olddata are purged from the hard disks.Even reformatting the hard disk is not afool-proof method.A more reliable method of wiping out all data on the hard diskpermanently is to degauss (demagnetise) it.Another way is to physically destroy the hard disk by using an industrialshredder, by burning it, or by any other means to render it inoperable.But before you do any of these things, make sure you have backed up anydata you still need!Securely delete personal data and other confidential information inportable devicesOrganisations and individuals today own a number and variety of portabledevices that may contain personal data and other confidential information.These include smartphones, USB drives, tablets and portable hard disks.What happens to them when they are no longer wanted or needed?■■Smartphones and tablets are typically kept as spares, traded in, givenaway or discarded.USB drives and portable hard disks are typically used as secondary orback-up storage.When they become faulty they are thrown away.Again, organisations should make sure that there is no data, especiallypersonal data and other confidential information, in the portable device whenany of these things are done.And again, remember to back up the data first.For smartphones, a factory reset on the device is a must.We have heardstories of individuals who traded in their smartphones without a thoroughwipe-out of all the data in them.The new owners found bank accountnumbers and passwords still intact on the devices’ built-in memory.Because portable devices are small compared with computers, there is atendency to just throw them into a rubbish bin without wiping out all the datastored in them.We must not forget this step, otherwise the consequences could be severeif sensitive data were leaked.The methods used to erase data from portablehard disks and from USB drives are slightly different:■■Data stored in portable hard disks can be destroyed in the same way asfor computer hard disks.Data stored in USB drives, which use flash memory technology, can beerased by reformatting the device.But to be absolutely sure that the datais wiped out permanently, you should physically destroy the USB drive.Not the hardware, but the valuable dataJust as we take a lot of precautionary measures to safeguard our computersand portable devices when they are in active use, we should do likewisewhen these are no longer wanted and are to be disposed of or destroyed.What we should be most concerned with is not the hardware itself, butthe valuable data that is stored in the hardware.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations and individuals should adopt the following practices:■■■Before discarding unwanted computers and portable devices, remember to back up thedata you need.Ensure that the data stored in unwanted computers and portable devices is permanentlywiped out before the hardware is transferred to another owner or discarded.Check with vendors or experts on how best to destroy different types of computer harddisks and portable devices.SECTION G:",,," How are computers and portable devices used?

134,134,much personal data?,"A lot of our personal and sensitive information passes through the hands ofagents, for example real estate agents, travel agents or employees ofdomestic maid agencies.In the course of providing services to their clients,especially when they act as go-betweens between clients and governmentdepartments, these agents are privy to personal and sensitive informationcontained in our national identification cards, passports, income taxassessments, bank statements, credit card information, and even our familymembers’ and dependents’ birth certificates and salary slips.Why should agents and service providers be privy to so much personaldata?In Singapore, for example, all these personal data and other confidentialinformation are required by certain government departments to assess theeligibility of potential buyers of public housing units, applicants for visas orpotential employers of domestic maids.The agents are merely acting as“couriers” of such documentary proofs to the government departments thatneed them.The agents claim that the “courier” service is part of the value-add theyprovide to their clients, so that the clients need not go personally to thegovernment departments to deliver the documents.I have even heard horrorstories of agents’ value-added services that include obtaining their clients’single sign-on user ID and password (for signing in to e-governmentservices) and retrieving their clients’ personal data on their behalf.With thissingle sign-on user ID and password to all e-government services, what is toprevent an unscrupulous agent from accessing other personal data andconfidential information of their clients from other government departments?I often wonder why the agents need to have full view of all the personaland confidential documents that we submit to government departmentsthrough them.They do not process the information except to act as a“courier” between the client and the relevant departments.The agents reallyhave no legitimate business or legal purpose to view such personal andsensitive information.Changing current practiceGranted that clients would still expect the “courier” service to be providedby their agents, can we not change the current practice to limit the disclosureof our personal and sensitive information to the agents?We could put all ourdocuments into a large envelope ourselves, seal the envelope and sign acrossthe envelope flaps to prevent tampering, before we pass the envelope to theagent.The relevant government departments can provide a checklist of thedocuments to be submitted through the agents to ensure that we don’t miss outanything.Clients have to be educated and made aware that they should not readilyhand over their user ID and password to their agents.They should approachsomeone who is more IT-savvy and trusted if they do not know how to usethe online e-government services.Such trusted persons could be their familymembers or relatives.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESAs individuals, we should limit the exposure of our personal data and other confidentialinformation to agents acting on our behalf by doing the following:■■Put all confidential documents in a sealed enveloped before passing them to the agent ifthey are merely acting as a “courier” between us and the relevant governmentdepartment.Do not reveal to the agent our user ID and password for signing in to e-governmentservices.If we cannot sign in ourselves, we should use someone who is more trusted,such as a family member or a relative.77",,," What are some types of personal data?

136,136,resignations and employee warnings,"Here is a friendly warning if you work in the Human Resource Department ofyour organisation or if you have individuals reporting to you or working foryou.The data protection law requires an organisation to protect the personaldata of its employees.This applies to both disclosure to other employees ofthe organisation, which should be restricted to a “need to know” basis, anddisclosure to third-party individuals and organisations.So be careful how you treat personal data about your or yourorganisation’s employees.Not surprisingly, lapses tend to be reported to thedata protection regulator most often when it comes to resignations andperformance warnings.Limit circulation of warning emailsThe supervisor of an executive member (X) of an academic department in auniversity sent X a warning letter when the supervisor was dissatisfied withX’s work performance.The supervisor also acted as secretary of acommittee at the university.The supervisor sent a copy of the warning emailto all members of that committee.X complained to the regulator1 on the basisthat personal data about X was disclosed without X’s consent.The university explained to the regulator that it was necessary to send acopy of the warning email to all members of the committee because one of itsresponsibilities was to advise the university on “deployment of human andother resources”.Therefore, said the university, committee members neededa copy of the warning email so they could each “assess the deficiency foundby the supervisor on X’s work performance”.However, the regulator concluded that there was insufficient evidence toshow that the committee members were empowered to review X’s workperformance.This was because X’s supervisor “merely forwarded thewarning email to the Committee members without requesting the recipients torender their advice and views on the Complainant’s performance”.The regulator said that the university’s disclosure of the warning email tothe members of the Committee should have been on a “need to know” basis.Therefore, it found that the university had failed to comply with the dataprotection law.The regulator required the university to “take steps to notify its staff whoare empowered to give written warnings to staff members not to disclose thecontents of the warnings to any third-party unless the disclosure was for thesame purpose as or a purpose directly related to the purpose of collection, orthe prescribed consent has been obtained from the data subject”.Do not include excessive information in employee resignation notices tothird-partiesIt is normal for organisations to send emails or faxes to customers to informthem of the resignation of an employee with whom they have been interacting.This might be done to let the customer know which employee will be dealingwith them in the future.In addition, it is usually intended to prevent the ex-employee from soliciting business from the organisation’s clients.However, one organisation included not only the name of the employeebut also the individual’s identity card number in the notice.It did this withoutthe individual’s knowledge or consent.When they found out, they complainedto the data protection regulator.2The regulator found that the organisation failed to comply with the dataprotection law because it had not taken reasonable practicable steps toprotect the individual’s identity card number from accidental or unauthoriseduse.It issued a warning notice to the organisation and directed it to delete theidentity card number from such messages.The regulator said:When an employee resigns, the use of his personal data for thepurpose of notifying customers is regarded as being a use of thedata for [a purpose directly related to employment].However, thepersonal data used for such a purpose should be limited to thosedata which are sufficient to fulfil the purpose of notification.Thedisclosure of the employee’s name and position in the companyshould be sufficient to identify the employee in the notification.Disclosing the employee’s identity card number is unnecessary andmay lead to possible misuse of that number for fraudulent or otherimproper purposes .Remote monitoring of employees may be unlawfulAn organisation installed a CCTV system.On two separate occasions, anemployee received phone calls from their employer followed by writtenwarnings about their performance although the employer was not on thepremises.The employer had installed CCTV cameras in the office so as tomonitor employees remotely.The employee complained to the regulator3 that the organisation wascollecting personal data through the inappropriate use of the CCTV systemthat had been installed without first notifying employees about the reasons forinstalling it.As is common, the organisation installed the CCTV system for securitypurposes.The organisation:■■■■■acknowledged that it had not informed its employees in writing about theCCTV system being installed and the purposes for installing itsaid that the cameras were overt and that the recorder and screenshowing views and recordings were in the office in full view of bothstaff and clients said that the system was installed during working hoursin full view of the employees and that no query, question or complaintwas received from either employees or clientsnoted that there was a sign stating that CCTV cameras were in operation,although the sign did not include the purposes for installing them, andargued, therefore, that its employees knew about the CCTV system.The regulator said that:any monitoring must be a proportionate response by an employer tothe risk he or she faces taking into account the legitimate privacyand other interests of workers … To meet transparencyrequirements, staff must be informed of the existence of the CCTVsurveillance and also of the purposes for which personal data areto be processed by CCTV systems .The regulator directed the organisation to cease monitoring employees byremotely accessing the CCTV system or by any other means.Theorganisation confirmed that it would:■■remove the cameras in the office andcease any disciplinary actions on foot against the employee on the basisof the CCTV surveillance and ensure that the employee would not sufferas a result of any information seen on camera.As a general rule, organisations may use CCTV to monitor employees if theydo so transparently.For example, employees should be notified, including bya notification in the organisation’s employee handbook.Fulfil requests for documents by dismissed employeesIn another case involving a university, an ex-employee made a data accessrequest asking for documents relating to their dismissal.The universitysatisfied their request.The individual felt that the university had incorrectlyedited out certain information in an extract of minutes of a meeting.Theindividual complained to the regulator.4The regulator investigated the complaint.The university claimed that theinformation missing from the extract of minutes was not personal data.Instead, the university said it was information related to the review of theuniversity’s internal mechanism of handling the individual’s complaint.Theregulator disagreed.Therefore the regulator found that “the complainant should have beenentitled to a copy of the whole extract of minutes subject to the deletion ofother individuals’ personal data”.It also required the university to reviewand revise its internal guidelines and procedures in relation to handling dataaccess requests.Guidelines for organisationsWhen processing personal information relating to employees, those withmanagerial duties or doing HR-related work should be aware of theirobligations and principles relating to the data protection law.When it comesto warnings and resignations, ensure that no excessive personal informationis collected or disclosed in relation to the HR purpose of employment.Is it possible for the above scenarios to happen within your organisation?If so, review and revise your internal guidelines as they relate to employeewarnings, dismissals and resignations, ensuring that all relevant staff aretrained accordingly.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should adopt the following practices when handling the personal data of theiremployees:■■■■Limit circulation of warning emails to employees by ensuring that only the relevantsupervisors are copied.When sending out notices to third-parties about employees who have resigned, ensurethere is no excessive information such as identity card numbers.There needs to be transparency when using CCTV surveillance for the secondarypurpose of employee monitoring.Adequately fulfil access requests from dismissed employees or those who haveresigned.There is no exception.1234Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, HK, Case

137,137,Complaints about complaints – the,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
138,138,problem with disclosing personal data,"One of our clients manages a condominium and shared an interesting incidentwith us.The occupiers of a unit – let’s call them X – lodged a complaint againstthe occupiers of a unit above them – whom we’ll call Y. To investigate it, thecondo manager forwarded X’s complaint to Y. The condo manager’sintentions were good but the complaint included X’s identity and unit number.So Y knew who made the complaint.This, of course, upset X. Not longafterwards, the condo manager received a letter from X’s lawyer claimingthat, by disclosing X’s personal data to Y, the condo manager had failed tocomply with the data protection law.In your organisation, have you received a complaint about a complaintsimilar to the above incident?It can easily happen when employees are nottrained to be conscious of the risks of disclosing personal data and toproceed with care.And where the organisation does not have clear policiesand practices about disclosing personal data.Under the data protection law, organisations must put reasonable securitymeasures in place to protect personal data under their care.That includes notrevealing the identity of a complainant without their consent.Employeeshandling complaints must be well trained about the organisation’s policiesand practices that are intended to protect personal data.Disclosures such as that mentioned above are not uncommon andregulators around the world have taken action in response to complaints.Some examples follow.Disclosure of bullying case against co-workersIn Australia, an employee complained to their employer about bullying byco-workers1.The complaint included a chronological list of all of the allegedbullying incidents.The employee handling the complaint said that, as part of the complaintsmanagement process, a full copy of the complaint would have to be providedto each of the alleged bullies.The employee making the complaint consentedto this initially, thinking that there was no other choice.But, later theychanged their mind and withdrew their consent by email.This was becausethey were anxious about the information contained in the complaint, whichhad documented their private reactions to certain incidents.Unfortunately, the complaint had already been disclosed to the allegedbullies, in accordance with the organisation’s internal policy forinvestigating complaints.The employee complained to the regulator that the organisation had failedto comply with the data protection law when it provided the full complaintdocumentation to each of the alleged bullies.The complaint was that theorganisation had disclosed to each alleged bully the full list of bullyingincidents, and the complainant’s reaction to each incident, instead of eachalleged bully knowing only what was relevant to themselves.In responding to the complaint, the organisation argued that, even if it hadreceived the withdrawal of consent prior to distribution, disclosing thecomplaint in full was a necessary part of the organisation’s complaintsinvestigation process.Further, the organisation said that it was “notreasonably possible” to edit the complaint documentation before distributingit.■■■However, the regulator ruled that:there was excessive disclosure of the complainant’s personal data to thealleged bulliesby being told that disclosing the complaint to the alleged bullies was partof the complaint investigation process the complainant was not given areal choice about what would happen with their personal data andthe organisation had not taken reasonable steps to protect the personaldata.The complaint was resolved by the organisation apologising to thecomplainant, agreeing to change its policies relating to bullyinginvestigations, and paying compensation to the complainant.Disclosure of student’s personal data by schoolA secondary school issued a letter headed “To Whom It May Concern” inconnection with a complaint and that included personal data about a student,X. Without the knowledge or consent of X or of a parent of X, the schoolgave a copy of the letter to Y, a parent of another student.The parent of X complained to the regulator about the unauthoriseddisclosure of X’s personal data.In the investigation that followed, the schooladministrator said that when Y requested the letter, they did not know why Ywanted it.They were unaware that handing it over was a failure to complywith the data protection law.Ultimately, the school resolved the issue amicably with X’s parents.Theschool decided to redraft its data protection policy to ensure compliancewith the data protection law – specifically, not to disclose the personal datain complaints to a third-party without consent from any individual who is asubject of the complaint.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESWhen handling complaints about the disclosure of personal data of individuals without theirconsent, organisations should do the following:■■■■■Investigate what led to the complaint and what steps are required to address the matter,in line with organisational policy.Inform the complainant that the personal information provided could be forwarded torelevant parties as part of the complaint and investigation process.Provide the complainant with a real choice about what will happen with their personalinformation and an option to withdraw consent.Take reasonable steps to protect the personal information.Keep disclosure of personal information to a minimum – only what the relevantindividuals “need to know” in order to respond to the complaint.1Office of the Victorian Privacy Commissionerhttps://www.cpdp.vic.gov.au/images/content/pdf/privacy_case_notes/case_note_03_11.pdf 79",,," Who lodged a complaint against them?

139,139,Does your notice board contain personal,"data?We often see notice boards at work, school and public places.The dataprotection law means that we must be careful about whether and how wedisclose personal data about individuals.Oh, and don’t forget that notice boards are not necessarily physical.Ourcomments here apply to electronic notice boards too.Even when theelectronic notice board is, say, a website that is accessible only to thestudents in a class or the students in a graduating year.And they also apply tonotices published in newspapers and other media.Beware when posting examination resultsWhenever a school, university or other educational institution postsexamination results, it discloses personal data of the students – namely, theirresults, as well as any personal data that identifies each student.Therefore,the organisation must comply with the data protection law.Here are some data protection compliance tips for organisations that postexamination results:■■Give students optionsThe organisation might prefer to post examination results on a designatednotice board, but should give candidates the option of getting their resultsmailed to them individually.From a student perspective, not everybodywants their results to be shared with others, especially if they performbadly in their exams.Get student consentWhen students sign up for your courses or examinations, it’s a goodopportunity to seek their consent to your organisation later publishingtheir results on a notice board.But make sure your organisation has agood system in place for tracking which students have consented, which■■have not consented and which, having consented, later withdraw theirconsent.Build in security measuresAs a good practice, when your organisation posts examination results ona notice board (with the consent of students) it should build in reasonablesecurity measures.For example, it should not reveal students’ fullidentity card or student numbers.To distinguish between students with thesame or similar names, use the last four digits only or use a graduationclass reference.Consider anonymising published examination resultsStudents usually like to be able to compare their results with the resultsof their friends.And of their enemies.Of course, they can only compareif names are published on the notice board.Some organisations may prefer to avoid the need for getting consent topublish names and the need to keep track of consents given, not given, orgiven and withdrawn.Therefore they issue each student with aconfidential examination number or reference, instructing students to keeptheir individual number confidential.Students find out their own examination results by looking for theirconfidential number in the list of results.They can compare their resultswith the results of their friends only if they have disclosed theirconfidential numbers with each other.Posting a complaint letter on the office’s notice boardAn employee complained in writing about their supervisor who had set dutyrosters.The person responsible for resolving the complaint gave thesupervisor a copy of the complaint so they could respond to it in person.Thesupervisor posted the complaint and a memo setting out the findings fromresolving the complaint on the notice board inside the staff rest room.Theemployee complained to the regulator1 about disclosure of their personaldata.This was an obvious breach of the data protection law.The regulatorfound that the supervisor ought to have known that the information was to beused for investigation purposes only.It concluded that even if the employeehad given consent for disclosure of personal data to a relevant individual(namely, the supervisor), it was unlikely they would have given consent tothe public display of the complaint.Management company posting a resident’s personal dataA resident of a building was involved in two pending litigations, namely, aSmall Claim filed by the building’s management company and a LandsTribunal claim filed against the incorporated owner of the building.The management company for the building called for an owners’ meetingto discuss the pending litigations.It mailed the resident a letter inviting her toattend the meeting.In addition, it posted the letter to the resident on thetenants’ notice board, which was in a public area of the building.This upsetthe resident, who then complained to the regulator2 about her name andaddress being disclosed publicly by the management company.The regulator concluded that the purpose for collecting the resident’spersonal data was for management of the building.However, the publicdisplay of the letter inviting attendance at the owners’ meeting wasunnecessary, as the letter had already been mailed to the resident.Therefore,there was an unauthorised disclosure of the resident’s personal data.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations posting notices on public notice boards with disclosure of personal data ofindividuals should adhere to the following:■■■■If you intend to post personal data about individuals on a public notice board (or even asa notice on a website), you must get consent from the relevant individuals.Your purpose for posting personal data on a public notice board must be consistent withthe purpose for which you collected the personal data.Consider the sensitivity of the contents of any notice posted on a public notice board.Ifthe notice relates to a complaint or is potentially embarrassing to the relevant individual,send a private letter or an email instead.Do not assume that individuals will not mind their personal data being posted publicly – inyour position you may not mind, but from their perspective it may be harmful.12Office of the

140,140,and to warn?,"Just take a stroll along the street and wander into any office or shop, andwhat is one of the most common things you see?If your answer is “closedcircuit television (CCTV) cameras”, you are absolutely right.Coming in all shapes and sizes and designs, CCTV cameras have becomeindispensable technological tools for security and surveillance purposes.ButCCTV cameras are non-discriminatory: they capture every inanimate objectand every living thing within their video capture zones.When images of human faces are captured at the right angles, uniqueindividuals can be identified visually and, more alarmingly, by facerecognition software.That is why a number of jurisdictions with dataprotection laws treat CCTV footage with human beings in it as personal dataor personally identifiable information.This means that CCTV footage shouldbe protected the same way as any other personal data and individuals have aright to request access to footage of themselves.Organisations cannot deny individuals’ right of access to CCTV footageUnder data protection laws in most of the world, once organisations havepersonal data in their possession or under their control, individuals have aright to access it.Therefore, organisations cannot deny the right ofindividuals to access the CCTV footage containing their image.While satisfying the legal obligation to provide access to such CCTVfootage is one thing, the practical difficulties in making such footageavailable is another thing.This is because when the organisation extracts therelevant segment of the footage for an individual to view, the data protectionlaw requires it to make sure that no images of other individuals aredisclosed.It must, for example, mask out at least the faces of otherindividuals in the same footage.But this is easier said than done.Not allCCTV equipment has the capability to do so, especially legacy systems usingolder technology.Even with newer CCTV equipment, not all organisationshave the in-house expertise to do the masking.Hiring a vendor to do it can beprohibitively expensive.And, sometimes, masking the personal data ofanother person may defeat the purpose for which individuals want access totheir personal data.For example, a parent whose child was pushed to theground at the school playground and sustained injuries as a result would wantto find out the identity of the person who did it.Figuring out a practical solutionSome organisations have come up with a compromise with individualrequesters by working around the practical problems associated withdisclosing personal data of other individuals in CCTV footages.First, the organisation needs to find out from the individuals why theywant access to the CCTV footage.This is also one way to weed out frivolousrequests.Then the organisation can work with the individual to figure out apractical solution that meets the individual’s needs and enables theorganisation to comply with the data protection law.For example, we have clients in the property and facility managementbusiness who shared with us the practical solutions they have developed.Some of them have told us that most requests for access to CCTV footagecome from owners of cars which have been scratched or dented when parkedat the premises’ car park.These types of incidents involve an investigationby the property or facility manager.For the purposes of the investigation, theproperty or facility manager views the CCTV footage and reports back to thecar owner the status of the investigation and any action taken against theculprit.A similar approach may be used to investigate stolen property orhouse break-ins.Consent required for CCTV surveillanceOrdinarily, an organisation is not permitted by the data protection law tocollect personal data about individuals without their consent.Anorganisation should display a sign warning of the presence of CCTV camerasand their purpose before an individual steps into their range.For example,such a sign might be displayed at the entrance to a building or outside a roomwhere CCTV cameras are installed.If so, and the individuals step into therange of the CCTV camera, they implicitly consent to the organisationcollecting their personal data, their image, in the CCTV footage.However, if the organisation fails to display such a warning sign, theindividuals whose images are captured by the CCTV camera can challengethe organisation for failing to comply with the consent requirement of the dataprotection law.Worse, if the individuals demand access to CCTV footage oftheir images and obtain them, they can show evidence that the organisationcollected their personal data without consent (whether implicit or not).CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should adopt the following measures and procedures when handling CCTVfootage:■■Display signs at prominent locations to inform visitors that CCTV surveillance is beingused.When a request to access CCTV footage is received,•••first determine the purpose of the request to weed out frivolous requestersthen mask out the faces of other identifiable individualsview the CCTV footage

145,145,Take requests for personal data seriously –,"or elseAll data protection laws grant individuals the right to access and correcttheir personal data in the possession or under the control of organisations.The time within which the organisation must respond to any such requestvaries from place to place, though it is typically now within the range of 20to 40 days and set to reduce from 40 days to 30 days in Europe by 2018.Will organisations really get into trouble if they fail to meet theregulatory deadlines to respond to or fulfil an individual’s request forpersonal information?The short answer is “yes, definitely”.And the dataprotection laws often provide significant penalties for such failures.Here are a few examples.Unacceptable delay by O2 in processing an access requestO2 is a telecommunications provider.An O2 customer asked for a copy ofcall records in respect of a mobile phone number from November 1999 to thedate of the access request, which was in 2012.Under the relevant dataprotection law an organisation must respond to an access request byproviding the requested personal data to the individual within 40 days ofreceiving the request.However, O2 took two months to reply to the request.The customer complained to the regulator.1The regulator’s investigations revealed that the delay was caused by thefollowing:■■The telephone number used by O2 when conducting its initial search ofits database contained an incorrect digit.More than two months after receiving the request, O2 requested a fee of€6.35 and did not commence processing the request until it received thefee.■ O2 admitted that, due to technical limitations, all such requests made toO2 could take up to ten weeks to process.Therefore, even if the retrieval process had commenced as soon as theaccess request was received, the 40-day statutory timeframe would notlikely have been met by O2, resulting in a failure by O2 to comply withthe regulatory requirement.The regulator required O2 to implement measures necessary for it to respondto access requests within the statutory timeframe.Failure to respond to an access requestAn individual made a request to a contracted service provider (CSP) foraccess to personal data in its possession.The CSP responded to the requestafter 24 days, explaining that it was seeking legal advice.When thecomplainant followed up with the CSP, 57 days after the initial request, theCSP said it was waiting for final legal advice and would respond afterreceiving it.The complainant lost patience when the request was not fulfilled112 days after the initial request and filed a complaint with the regulator.2The regulator expressed concern about the length of time taken to respondto the request.It questioned whether “obtaining legal advice” was asufficient reason for delay.It found no reason to decline the request andissued a notice to the CSP requiring them to satisfy it by sending relevantpersonal data to the complainant.Not taking a data access request seriouslyAn ex-employee made a data access request to their former organisation for acopy of their personal data relating to their employment.When they did notget a response after several months, they contacted the organisation, whichsaid that the requested data was ready for dispatch.However, they were laterinformed that the requested data was already destroyed.The ex-employeecomplained to the regulator.3When the regulator investigated the complaint, the organisation suddenlyclaimed to have discovered the requested personal data.At different times itgave varying reasons to justify its failure to comply with the access request.While it might have taken more prescriptive action, the regulator formallywarned the organisation and reminded it to comply with the relevantrequirements of the data protection law when handling data access requestsin future.Excessive fee imposed for compliance with data access requestA woman had a colonoscopy at a private hospital.She complained about thepresence of male non-medical staff in the operating room during thecolonoscopy.Dissatisfied with the hospital’s reply, the woman submitted adata access request to the hospital.She sought copies of “all data, includingany recording, and including medical notes, concerning [her] consultationwith Dr [X], colonoscopy and subsequent complaint”.The hospital gave the woman a copy of nine pages of her medical recordsand charged her a total fee of HK$3,250.She complained to the regulator4 onthe basis that the fee was excessive.The regulator concluded that an organisation is allowed to charge onlythe costs that are “directly related to and necessary for” complying with adata access request.It said that any fee that exceeds the costs of compliancewould be considered as excessive.5 Because the hospital did not give abreakdown of the costs, the regulator in this case said that the hospital shouldhave a proper indexing system for patients’ medical records, and would notrequire an extensive search, resulting in unnecessary costs and time.(Note: For data protection laws such as those in Singapore and HongKong that do not state a maximum fee and which recommend a reasonable feefor access requests, organisations should not make a profit by chargingexcessive fees.The general guide is that organisations should charge a feethat allows them to recover only the labour costs and actual out-of-pocketexpenses involved in the process of complying with a data access request.)Guidance for organisationsThe above case studies demonstrate the importance of complying with theaccess requests made by individuals under the data protection law,whichever jurisdiction is involved.Organisations should adopt the goodpractices as laid out in the “Checklist of Good Practices”.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should adopt the following practices when they receive requests fromindividuals to access and correct their personal data held by the organisations:■■■■■■■Take the applicable statutory time period laws seriously.Authenticate the identity of the individual making the request to avoid disclosing personaldata to the wrong person.Have policies and processes in place to quickly acknowledge the request and then torespond to it without undue delay.If the request falls within an exemption and your organisation decides to rely on thatexemption, give written notice of the refusal and your organisation’s reasons for it withinthe required time period.If there is a valid reason why your organisation must not comply with the request, givewritten notice of refusal and, if permitted by the data protection law, reasons for refusalwithin the required time period.If your organisation has technical difficulty retrieving the personal data within thestipulated timeline, put in place a plan to remedy the situation as soon as reasonablypossible.Commence processing the request as soon as practical to ensure that there are nodelays, even if the information is not released until any access fees are paid.12345Data Protection Commissioner, Ireland, Case Study

flat and blocknumber, which were commonly adopted and used by the managementcompany.The property owner was displeased about being a subject ofridicule and lodged a complaint with the regulator.2The regulator considered that the management company for thecondominium was responsible for the poem being uploaded to the chat roombecause it was uploaded by one or more of its employees in the course oftheir employment (versus the upload being done by them in their personal ordomestic capacity).The regulator reached this decision because:■■■■■the poem was confirmed to have been uploaded through

comments from the residents which might be relevant tomanagement mattersits employees were aware that some senior officers of the organisationhad been the target of attack in the websitethe complainant’s name and address were personal data that could beeasily obtained and known to its employees anda piece of paper containing the user ID and log-in password was stucknear the computer so that employees could easily share using it.The regulator concluded that the organisation did not have in place sufficientmonitoring, policies and guidelines to prevent its employees using personaldata about property owners improperly.It directed the organisation to takeremedial steps to protect property owners’ personal data.So what can we learn from the above case studies?Watch what you say about

applies.You will never know if someone spills the beans on you or the person whosepersonal data you disclosed without consent might discover it and thisbackfires on you.It will be a greater risk for you if you share personal dataonline as there are no “walls”.So often, I read comments from property agents, financial advisers andfreelancers complaining about their clients on Facebook, supported by anumber of “Likes”.If employees can get fired with irresponsible comments,how much worse can it get for these business owners (or data controllers)when it comes to failing to comply with the data protection law?As for organisations, the above case studies can also happen in youroffice and implicate your company.Ensure your staff are trained andunderstand their obligations under the data protection law.Your organisationwill be held responsible for any breaches by your employees in the course oftheir employment.So ensure you have policies and guidelines in place andcontinue to monitor for potential data breaches, negligence or even mischiefthat may arise.If your organisation uses chat rooms or social media, create an onlineusage and social media policy that limits what your employees can do,sharing only the data needed to provide the service or feature.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESWhen disclosing personal information about other individuals, organisations and

149,149,You leave behind more than your,"footprints and fingerprintsSo, you have:■■■trodden the corridors of power and history of the ancient monarchs,aristocrats, noblemen, the famous and the infamoustraipsed about towns and villages in search of exotic local produce andindigenous handicrafts andtrampled small creatures underfoot on sandy beaches and verdantmountain trails.You feel satisfied that you now have the bragging rights to declare: “I’vebeen there, done that!”You have left behind your footprints and fingerprintsat the “must-go” places of the world.But do you realise that when you travel overseas you leave behind morethan your footprints and fingerprints?You actually leave behind a whole trailof “infoprints” – personal data about you.Here are a few examples of whereyour “infoprints” are being captured:■■■■at the immigration checkpoint when you enter a countrywhen you book a tour or hotel accommodation overseas through a travelagency or web portalwhen you use a payment card to make purchases overseas and thetransaction is not done electronicallywhen you use the roaming feature of your mobile phone overseasThe immigration officer who checked your passport, the tour agent who tookyou to scenic attractions, the hotels you stayed in, the restaurants you dinedat, the shops you patronised, and the telecommunications companies whoseservices you used, all have some of your personal data.Can you be assuredthat these organisations and individuals overseas would respect theconfidentiality and privacy of your personal data and handle themappropriately and securely?Transfer of personal data overseasA number of jurisdictions around the world have data protection laws thatplace restrictions on organisations sending personal data across internationalborders.However, those data protection laws do not apply if you book your touror hotel accommodation directly with a tour agency or hotel overseas orthrough a web portal located overseas.In these instances, what can you do tohave some assurance that your personal data will be handled appropriatelyand securely by the overseas tour agency, hotel or online service provider?Here are some tips:■■■First, consider whether you will be providing personal data to anorganisation that is located in a jurisdiction with a data protection lawand whether that law is enforced by a responsible regulator.Next, check the published privacy policies of the overseas organisations,especially the consent clauses, your rights, the company’s responsibilitiesand obligations – although a published privacy policy is no guarantee thatthe organisation actually acts in accordance with it.Finally, provide minimal personal data to the overseas organisation.Ifbooking online, complete only those data fields that are compulsory (asindicated by asterisks) or use a different booking site if there arealternatives.If booking over the phone, challenge requests for personaldata except where it is obviously necessary.Vigilance is the order of the dayIt is near impossible to wipe off every trace of your “infoprints” when youtravel overseas.But you can minimise the risk of exposure by adopting apolicy of self-vigilance.Here are some tips:■■■Use web portals offered by reputable organisations when you make youroverseas holiday or hotel bookings.Make payments online only if the website indicates that a reputableorganisation has implemented a secure online payment mechanism – ifyou don’t know about secure online payment mechanisms, the banks orother organisations that issued the payment card you want to use will beable to tell you what to check before using your card.As mentioned above, check the published privacy policies oforganisations to which you may disclose your personal data.■■Do not disclose your personal data or passport details unnecessarily(such as to sales outlets or sales people).If organisations seek to collectit, do not be shy about asking them the purpose for which they need it –or, to put it the other way around, keep the personal data that you discloseto the minimum.Ensure that the salesperson handling your payment card does not makemultiple imprints on paper payment slips or take snapshots of your carddetails in non-electronic transactions. (In some retail stores orrestaurants, for example, the cashier’s counter is located a distance awayfrom the customers’ area.The salesperson takes the customer’s paymentcard to process the payment behind the counter.The customer shouldmake sure that the salesperson is within sight.)Remember, you do not want to leave behind more than your footprints andfingerprints when you return from your overseas trips or holidays.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIndividuals planning and going for holidays overseas should take the following precautionarymeasures:■■■■■Only use web portals of reputable organisations when you book your holiday or hotelroom overseas.Make sure the reputable organisations have implemented secure online paymentmechanisms.Check with your payment card issuer if you need more information aboutsecure online payments.Find out if the organisation is located in a jurisdiction that has a data protection law that isenforced and check their privacy policies before you disclose your personal data.Do not disclose your personal data unnecessarily.Disclose just enough for the intendedpurpose.Choose alternatives if the organisation seems to be seeking personal dataunnecessarily.In non-electronic payment card transactions, ensure the salesperson handling your carddoes not make multiple imprints or take photos of your card details.88",,," What do you leave behind at the “must-go” places of the world?

151,151,third-parties – proper consent sought?,"Almost all data protection laws in the world today require organisations toobtain consent from individuals before they can collect, use or disclose theindividuals’ personal data.But most jurisdictions don’t prescribe how theconsent clauses are to be worded, except for some guiding principles andguidelines.This is because different industry sectors, and even differentorganisations within the same sector, are so varied that it is well-nighimpossible to have standard consent clauses.The crafting of consent clausesis thus left to individual organisations.So, are most organisations doing it properly in seeking consent fromindividuals in their consent clauses?I have come across a few horror storiesof ambiguity in the wording of the consent clauses, especially where theindividuals’ personal data are to be disclosed to third-parties outside theorganisation.Update of club members’ personal particularsA country club, of which I’m a member, sent out a form to all its members toupdate their personal particulars.I filled in my membership number, fullname, home address, telephone number, email address, national identificationnumber, and bank account details (for the electronic transfer of funds to payfor the monthly subscription fees).So far so good.When I came to the end ofthe form I was alarmed by the small print that read:I authorise [Name of Club] or its representatives to obtain anyinformation from any source which it may require .The term “representatives” was so broad that it could refer to agents actingon behalf of the club, a separate entity of the club, or an outsourced vendor ofthe club membership system.This was tantamount to my giving the club acarte blanche to obtain any information from any source about me.I sent an email to the membership department asking them to clarify whotheir “representatives” were, what additional “information” about me theywould want to collect, and what these “sources” were.The membershipdepartment pointed me to the club’s data protection policy, which was just asvague.Even the club’s legal officer could not enlighten me further, as theclub had only recently implemented their data protection policy.I came awaywith the feeling that the club had not thought through carefully the operationalimplications of their consent clause on their members.Worse, they couldhave simply “copied” the consent clause from another organisation withouttailoring it to suit the unique operations of the club.Registration of purchasers’ personal particularsI bought a new household appliance for my home.It came with a one-yearwarranty and exchange policy.The warranty could only be activated after Iregistered with the supplier the serial number, model and description of theappliance, plus my personal particulars.Filling in all these details was not aproblem for me as I had done so umpteen times with other appliances andequipment I had bought in the past.What alarmed me was the consent clausein small print at the end of the warranty form, with two boxes for me to tickeither “yes” or “no”:I disagree with [Name of Supplier] collecting, using and disclosingmy personal data for the purposes of this warranty and for therepair or servicing of the registered appliance by [Name ofSupplier] or any service centre .First of all, the text was phrased in the negative, so if I were not careful andticked the “yes” box, I would end up with not granting the supplierpermission to collect, use and disclose my personal data for the statedpurpose.The warranty then would become null and void.I felt uneasy tickingthe “no” box to validate the warranty because it was too encompassing andunclear.I would have consented to the supplier collecting and using mypersonal data for the purpose of the warranty, but not to disclose it to anyservice centre without knowing what their relationship with the supplier was.The service centre could be part of the supplier’s group of companies, a jointventure or a totally outsourced outfit (which could even be based overseas).What the organisations should have doneAs shown in the anecdotes above, organisations should craft consent clausesnot merely to satisfy legal compliance with data protection laws.Theyshould think through carefully the operational implications of their consentclauses on their customers or members.They should use clear andunambiguous language and avoid such vague and all-encompassing terms as“any”.Where organisations provide choices for their customers or members,they must word the text such that it is not too all-encompassing.Somecustomers or members may consent to selective disclosure of their personaldata but not to the whole consent clause.In such instances, organisationsshould consider splitting their consent clauses into parts to allow theircustomers or members to make selective choices.When seeking consent from customers or members for disclosing theirpersonal data to third-parties, organisations must not use vague terms like“representatives” or “associates”, but be more explicit in stating theirrelationships with these third-parties.Examples of these third-parties couldbe entities within the same group of companies, joint ventures orpartnerships, or external vendors and service providers.While it may beargued that entities within the same group of companies could be treated asone, most data protection laws view such intra-group data-sharing asexternal disclosure, especially where each of the entities is a legal entity onits own.If organisations intend to disclose their customers’ or members’ personaldata to third-parties for a different purpose – sending of related marketingand promotional materials, for example – they should state it explicitly in theconsent clause.And organisations should give their customers or members achoice to opt-in and not assume that they agree by default.What should individuals do?Individuals should familiarise themselves with their rights under the localdata protection laws so that they can question organisations if the consentclauses are unclear or not specific enough.If in doubt, they should not givetheir consent so willingly to the organisations, especially where theirpersonal data is to be disclosed to third-parties whose relationships with theprimary organisations are not clear.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES■ When seeking individuals’ consent for the disclosure of their personal data to third-parties, organisations should:•••••Consider the operational implications and not just legal compliance with dataprotection laws.Refrain from using all-encompassing terms like “any”, “representatives” or“associates”.Be specific about the relationships between the third-parties and the organisation.Consider splitting the consent clause into parts to allow individuals to make selectivechoices.Spell out any new purpose if it is different from the primary organisation’s.■ Individuals should:••Familiarise themselves with their data protection rights so that they can question theorganisations on their consent clauses.Refrain from providing personal data when in doubt.SECTION H:New Areas, Developments andTechnological Concerns“Natural hazards could lead to natural disasters.But this does not apply to privacy risksand hazards.They are man-made, and therefore

152,152,Have you appointed a Data Protection,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
153,153,"Officer? Er, what’s that?","“Hello, can I please speak to your organisation’s Data ProtectionOfficer?”“Er, what’s that?We don’t have any such thing.”Are you the owner of an organisation?Are you an officer of an organisation,including a board director or a member of senior management?If so, andyour organisation receives such a call and your answer is that theorganisation doesn’t have any such thing, you could be in trouble.Not having a Data Protection Officer (DPO) is a breach of the dataprotection law where such an appointment is mandated by law – as it is in atleast 46 countries with data protection laws.In some countries, having a DPO is mandated for all organisations – forexample, in Singapore.Several companies in Singapore have been penalisedand fined for failing to implement proper and adequate data protectionmeasures, and one of the aggravating factors was that they had not appointeda DPO.1Sometimes, having a DPO is mandated for most organisations, as inGermany and the Philippines, and sometimes it’s required only under certainconditions, which many organisations will fulfil.In fact, if your organisationis in the European Union, the possible need to appoint a DPO is now underthe spotlight, due to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), whichcame into force on 25 May 2018.The GDPR requires organisations toappoint a DPO if their core activities include the regular and systematicmonitoring of individuals on a large scale or the processing of certain typesof sensitive personal data.The GDPR also requires public authorities in EUMember States that process personal data to appoint a DPO.The spotlight is especially bright because failure to appoint a DPO whenrequired is an infringement of the GDPR.Infringements can result in a fine ofup to €10 million, or 2% of the global annual turnover of the group ofcompanies, whichever is higher.2The rise of the DPOMore than 100 countries now have data protection / privacy laws.Prior tothe implementation of the GDPR, at least 18 countries outside the EU andfour Member States of the EU mandated the appointment of a DPO undercertain specified circumstances.Adding in the 24 Member States of the EUthat didn’t previously require a DPO, since 25 May 2018 a total of at least46 countries have mandated appointing a DPO in at least somecircumstances.A survey conducted for the International Association of PrivacyProfessionals in 20163 found that the departments within organisations thatwere responsible for data protection / privacy management then were:■■■■■Legal – 45%Regulatory Compliance – 27%Information Technology – 15%Corporate Ethics – 8%Others – 5%The survey suggests that a lawyer is most often appointed to the role, atbetween 45% of the time and 73% of the time, if one assumes that the staff inRegulatory Compliance are also generally lawyers.The figure might in factbe even higher than that, given that the only category above that will includevery few, if any, lawyers is Information Technology.But if you are the owner of an organisation or an officer of anorganisation, it’s worth looking at what a DPO does and considering whatskillsets are needed, before defaulting to the conclusion that the DPO shouldbe a lawyer.Appointing the wrong individual as the DPO could spell doomfor the organisation:■■From a regulatory perspective : They may not be capable of developing,implementing and operating the organisation’s data protection / privacyprogramme in compliance with regulatory requirements.From a business perspective : They may not have the practical businessexperience to develop, implement and operate a data protection / privacyprogramme that best supports the organisation’s business activities andtakes its risk appetite into account.Let’s look at what a DPO actually does and what skillsets they need in orderto do it.This will lead to an organisation-by-organisation conclusion aboutwho should be appointed as the DPO.What should a DPO actually do?Generally, a DPO is required to oversee the data protection / privacyresponsibilities of the organisation and to ensure compliance with dataprotection / privacy laws.But what does that actually mean on a day-to-daybasis?Here’s what a DPO should actually do to develop and implement adata protection / privacy programme effectively.■Assess what the organisation needs to do in order to comply with therelevant data protection law.If the organisation is only just starting to implement a data protection /privacy programme, the DPO’s first job will be to form a datagovernance team.It will be composed of, say, the heads of theorganisation’s departments that collect, use, disclose and/or storepersonal data – say, Human Resources, Finance, Sales, Marketing,Customer Service and, because it is the custodian of data, IT.In a smallorganisation or in a professional services firm, these types of functionsmay not be in separate departments and the DPO will need to decide howbest to cover them when forming a data governance team.Once the data governance team is formed, the DPO will need to leadthat team in making an inventory of personal data collected by theorganisation from various sources and map how it flows through theorganisation.Next, the DPO will need to guide the data governance team membersin how to identify and assess the data protection risks arising from thecollection, use, disclosure and/or storage of personal data within theorganisation.If the organisation has already implemented a data protectionmanagement programme, it might at any time be planning on adding a newor redesigned product or be planning new or redesigned systems orprocesses that involve the collection, use, disclosure and storage ofpersonal data.If so, the DPO will need to oversee data protection impact■assessments in connection with such new or redesigned products, systemsor processes.Protect the organisation against the data protection risks identifiedduring the assessment stage.After the data governance team has assessed the organisation’s dataprotection risks, the DPO will then work with team members to decidehow the organisation should manage those risks.This includes developing and implementing appropriate controls and■helping to document the data protection policies and practices that areneeded to operationalise the organisation’s data protection complianceprogramme.The DPO will need to ensure that operational policies andpractices comply with the relevant data protection / privacy law.Sustain the data protection management programme implemented by theorganisation to manage the data protection risks assessed by the datagovernance team.At this stage, the DPO will need to monitor compliance with the■organisation’s data protection policies and practices determined duringthe “Protect” stage.Respond to any stakeholder queries or data breaches.The DPO will need to respond to any queries and requests fromvarious stakeholders, or in the case of routine requests (such as dataaccess and correction requests), ensure that relevant staff within theorganisation are able to do so and provide them with assistance wherethey need it.The DPO should also report outcomes of the organisation’sdata protection management programme to senior management.The DPO will also need to respond to any data breach that affects theorganisation, including coordinating the breach response activities and,where relevant, notifying the regulator and the affected data subjects.Finally, and importantly, the DPO will serve as the point of contactbetween the organisation and the relevant data protection / privacyregulator(s).What skillsets does a DPO need?The skillsets needed by a DPO emerge from examining what a DPO actuallydoes on a day-to-day basis, namely:■ To begin to develop a data protection / privacy compliance programmeby forming and leading a data governance team and to lead it through theassessment phase of the data protection / privacy programme for theorganisation, the DPO needs:♦♦♦♦leadership skills, including interpersonal flexibility (cultural, globaland local) and the ability to communicate effectively with all relevantbusiness functions at both a senior level and “down the line” withinthe organisation and externallyseniority in the organisation (to be able to work well withdepartmental heads, for example) and to understand the organisation’soverall commercial objectives and its risk appetiteability to fulfil the DPO role autonomously and to earn the respect ofmore senior management, including obtaining financial and otherresources to support the work of the data governance teamproject management skills and operational experience sufficient tounderstand the organisation’s processes■ In the next step of the assessment phase of the data protection / privacyprogramme for the organisation, identifying risks arising from collecting,using, disclosing and/or storing personal data, the DPO needs:♦♦experience in identifying business risks, together with practical,operational experience in business processes and systems in order tounderstand the identified risks from a business perspectivelegal support to identify regulatory compliance risks■ In conducting data protection impact assessments as part of theorganisation’s data protection / privacy programme, the DPO needs:♦♦the ability to communicate with stakeholders on a business andprocess level in relation to new or redesigned products or systemsleadership and project management skills■ During the protection phase of the data protection / privacy programmefor the organisation, the DPO needs:♦♦practical, operational experience in business processes and systemsin order to understand how to manage identified risks from a businessperspectiveexperience in managing business risks and a thorough understandingof best-practice risk mitigation so that risks are managed consistentlywith applicable regulatory compliance requirements, legal expertise(including knowledge of the data protection / privacy laws of all♦♦♦jurisdictions relevant to the organisation) and independence indecision-making on legal issues (versus necessarily reaching legalconclusions that conform with what senior management wants tohear)practical, operational experience in business processes and systemsin order to help develop and to implement controls and to documentpolicies and practices / standard operating proceduresthe ability to understand IT systems and constraints at a level thatenables effective interaction with IT specialists in developingtechnical controls, such as system configuration and access rules,firewalls, etc.legal assistance in developing administrative controls, such asconfidentiality agreements, data-sharing agreements and dataprocessing agreements■ For the sustain phase of the data protection / privacy programme for theorganisation, the DPO needs:♦♦a range of practical management skills, including project managementexperience and knowledge of auditing business processes forcompliance against policycommercial and operational knowledge to interact with seniormanagement effectively■ Finally, for the response phase of the data protection / privacyprogramme for the organisation, the DPO needs:♦♦seniority in the organisation to enable the DPO to interact crediblywith the data protection / privacy regulator(s)legal support to identify regulatory requirements and to develop aregulatory response and/or strategyShould the DPO be a lawyer and should responsibility lie with the legaldepartment?Some people argue that the DPO must be a lawyer with experience in, and anin-depth understanding of, data protection law and practice.However, itcannot be taken for granted that such a lawyer will necessarily have all theskillsets required of a DPO.On a day-to-day basis, effective data protection/ privacy policies and practices are about operational compliance with legalrequirements, not about simply knowing what legal requirements apply to theorganisation.A lawyer with experience in, and an in-depth understanding of, dataprotection law and practice should not be the DPO unless they also have atleast the practical, operational experience in business processes and systemsthat are a large part of the job of a DPO.Or, they must have the ability towork very closely with, and respect the views of, others who do have suchexperience.Having the legal department responsible for data protection / privacymanagement has an “optics” disadvantage too.Good data protection /privacy practices should be the responsibility of all employees of anorganisation, just as good workplace safety and health practices are theresponsibility of all employees.The trouble with having the legal departmentresponsible for data protection / privacy management and appointing alawyer as the DPO is the very real danger that data protection / privacy willthen be seen as a legal department responsibility – and probably assomething that gets in the way of doing business. (The same holds true,although usually to a lesser degree, if an employee responsible forcompliance is appointed as the DPO of an organisation.There is a significantrisk that data protection will be seen as “just another one of thosecompliance things that makes getting on with business difficult”.)Should the DPO be a Chief Technology Officer or Chief Information Officer?Some people say that the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) – or, if they areresponsible for IT security, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) – should bethe DPO because data protection is all about IT safety and security.It is clear that “There is no privacy without security”, so a role withresponsibility for IT security is of obviously fundamental importance in adata protection / privacy programme.And, indeed, 15 percent oforganisations appoint a CTO or CIO as their DPO.The trouble with this is twofold.First, data protection risks need to bemanaged by a combination of technical, administrative and physical controls.Administrative and physical controls rarely fall within the CTO’s or CIO’sremit.Secondly, there is an obvious conflict of interest if an individual who isthe CTO or CIO is, as DPO, overseeing their own actions and inactions asCTO or CIO.In late 2016, the Bavarian Data Protection Authority penaliseda company for having its IT manager act as its DPO, resulting in a conflict ofinterest of this nature.The regulator notified the company of the conflict ofinterest and repeatedly asked it to appoint a new DPO.When the companyrefused, the regulator imposed a fine (the amount of the fine has not beenreleased).What is the one indispensable skill or characteristic of a DPO?Some of the skillsets needed by a DPO can be learned to a good extent –project management, for example, together with knowledge of theorganisation’s specific operations.Some components can be provided byadvisers – such as risk management and legal/regulatory knowledge.Thereis, however, one required skillset that can’t be learned or bought: leadershipskills, so that the DPO is capable of establishing a level of cooperationthroughout the organisation in connection with data protection policies andpractices.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICES■■■■Decide what skillsets an individual needs in order to be an effective DPO for yourorganisation.Appoint an individual who satisfies as many of the needed skillsets as possible.Do not assume that an individual with particular subject matter expertise is necessarilythe right person for the role versus examining their particular skillsets in addition to theirspecialty.Think outside the box.If your organisation is heavily involved in marketing, a veryexperienced marketing specialist, given the responsibility for data protection / privacycompliance, may be the best candidate!123See https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Commissions-Decisions/Data-Protection-Enforcement-Cases.Type “Data Protection Officer” in search box.As listed in Article 83(4) of the General

idea for a start-up!Fantastic, but don’t forget to respectprivacyAs part of our work, we often organise public education sessions to spreadthe word about data protection / privacy.We get a good sprinkling of peoplewho are working for start-ups or planning to found their own start-up – afterall, attendance at these sessions is free of charge, these people have heardsomething or other about data privacy and they have an underlying hope thatit’s not something they need to worry about.Our sessions are, they think, agreat opportunity to validate that underlying hope.We get statements andquestions from them that tend to boil down to:“Money is tight for start-ups.And, anyway, this data privacy stuff getsin the way of our great new business idea, and our millennial targetmarket doesn’t care about it anyway.So why should start-ups have toworry about it?”Why should start-ups worry about data privacy?The short answerThe short answer has three parts and they all affect a start-up’s bottom line:■■■First, in today’s ever-growing digital and data-sharing economy,respecting data privacy must be a fundamental part of your businessstrategy and company culture because stakeholders expect it.Second, individuals – even millennials! –do care about it whensomething goes wrong.Third, given that more than 100 countries have data protection / privacylaws, in many cases it’s a legal requirement too.This is especially the case if you are offering an online service or a mobileapplication, and venturing into either the European markets where dataprotection is well-established or into ASEAN markets where the dataprotection laws are relatively new.The following cases are some examples of how getting data protectionwrong can affect a start-up’s bottom line.■Collection of personal data… an example where individuals – evenmillennials – caredSense Smart Scale is a weighing machine that measures bone mass,muscle mass, total body fat and total body water.Actxa Swift and ActxaSwift+ are fitness trackers that track a user’s activity levels throughoutthe day.Users of these devices can use an app to access the datacollected by these devices to monitor their health.The data isautomatically collected by the servers of the organisation that sells thedevices and provides the app.One user of the Sense Smart Scale complained to the data protection■■regulator about the organisation transferring the personal data collectedvia the user’s Sense Smart Scale to its servers without the user’s consent.The regulator investigated and concluded that the organisation’s privacypolicy did not mention how the personal data of users could be collectedby the organisation from the app.Nor was there any other avenue bywhich the organisation obtained the necessary consent.Therefore, theregulator concluded that the user was unaware that their personal datawas being collected by the organisation and stored on its servers.Consequently, the regulator fined the organisation.Usage of personal data… an example where regulators caredAs a result of spying concerns, German privacy regulators have bannedsmart watches that have a listening function.They noted that parentscould secretly monitor a child’s environment, sometimes even listening inon teachers in classrooms.Some watches were also found to betransmitting the location of children unencrypted, leaving them open tohacking and spoofing.Disclosure of personal data… an example where potential clientsmust surely careSocial Metric is a digital marketing agency founded in 2010 andheadquartered in Singapore.Do a Google search on “social metric” (asof June 2018), and the news that the data protection regulator fined itS$18,000 in January 2018 is unmissable.Social Metric was fined for not putting appropriate data protection■controls in place and thereby allowing the personal data of their clients’customers to be readily accessed by any member of the public through thewebsites Social Metric created for those clients.That unmissablemessage must surely be of concern to potential clients!Storage of personal data… an example of adverse publicity wherestakeholders caredUber received substantial adverse publicity about its corporate cultureand ethics late in 2017.The then relatively new CEO wrote in a blogpost that Uber had concealed a data breach involving 57 millioncustomers and drivers worldwide.It had done so by paying hackersUS$100,000 to delete the data.Failing to notify data protection / privacyregulators of the data breach violated data breach notification rules inmany countries that have data protection / privacy rules.Why should start-ups worry about data privacy?The longer answerThe longer answer has several facets, but they all relate to the rise ofaccountability and the expectations of stakeholders.■■The rise of the concept of accountabilityIncreasingly, stakeholders – for example, customers, business partners,investors, regulators, the media – are demanding accountability when itcomes to personal data / privacy.Accountability for your start-up isabout you taking responsibility and building trust proactively with yourstakeholders.It’s about taking steps to make sure that you protectpersonal data / privacy as part of your business proposition and yourgreat new idea versus merely responding if and when something goeswrong.It includes getting rid of any “It won’t happen to me” attitude.Getting it right for yourselfYes, as the founder of a start-up, you are a stakeholder in it too.Imaginethat you’ve ploughed both your life savings and a great deal of “sweatequity” into your start-up and you’re about to officially launch yourproduct or service, to go “live” with it, just before you run out of money.Or that you’ve just received investment money for that official launch but– as is invariably the case – there’s a “claw-back” clause in case of anylast-minute problems.And now imagine that you are suddenly notified by a privacyregulator that there have been complaints that you “seriously invaded”personal data privacy in your beta product.As a result, the regulatororders you to cease operations pending a full investigation or orders youto delete all customer information (which happens to be your only asset).The question you’ll be facing is whether you’ve lost everything, or onlyalmost everything.If you already received investment money and spentsome of it before the investors exercised their exit option and claw-backrights, you likely have debt hanging over your head too.In our consulting work, we came across a start-up subscription■business that had a problem.It was operating in Europe and Asia, sellingmonthly subscriptions to consumers. (Netflix is a well-known example ofa subscription business.)It had built up a healthy revenue stream over itsthree or four years of operation.The founder decided to sell the business,the revenue stream, and moved ahead confidently to do so.But it turnedout that interested purchasers concluded after doing their due diligencethat they wouldn’t buy it because data protection / privacy requirementshadn’t been satisfied when signing up customers.The founder had to starton a lengthy and expensive exercise to try to rectify the problems so thatthe start-up would be saleable at some point in the future.The founderalso had to indefinitely put on hold their plans for a new venture that wasto have been funded by the sale of the subscription business.Getting it right for your start-up’s customersWhen you have a great new idea that’s fuelling your start-up, it’s almostalways the case that there are variations of the same idea popping uphere, there and everywhere… and if that’s not happening at the outset, itwill happen as soon as the copy-cats figure out what you’re doing.Your start-up needs a competitive edge against your competitors.■Building customer trust through data privacy best practices is key, notbecause your customers necessarily care when things are going well, butbecause they do care when there is a data protection problem.Bestpractices in data privacy reduce the risk of problems, such as a privacybreach occurring.Getting it right for your start-up’s business partnersMany start-ups need business partners as well as customers in order toscale up and build their business and customer base quickly.And mostpotential business partners have many choices about who to get on boardwith – they get start-ups pitching to them very regularly.Typically, the most desirable business partners for start-ups are largeand well-established businesses, including multinational corporations(MNCs) and larger companies from the small and medium businesssector (SMEs).So your start-up needs to stand out amongst the crowdvying for their attention.MNCs and larger SMEs have their house in order regarding data■privacy and are careful about partnering with any organisation that mightadversely affect their brand or image, including by way of a data privacybreach.Being able to demonstrate that your start-up embraces dataprivacy best practices may not be enough to win your start-up a mostdesirable partner, but not being able to do so will almost certainly lead tofailure in winning that partner.Getting it right for your start-up’s investorsImagine pitching to venture capitalists or prospective investors on themassive potential of your great new idea only to be asked, “What aboutdata privacy and complying with data privacy laws?”And you are totallyoblivious to the importance of respecting data privacy or you simplyhaven’t ranked it high enough among the many things your start-up needsto do.Potential investors doing due diligence on your start-up will have inmind: How much money might I make out of this investment and how willI monetise my investment?What if they discover that the data-sharing business model youproposed or acquired is illegal?What if this discovery comes at a timewhen your start-up is still struggling to get some scale and you arerunning out of money?What if they discover that the General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) applies to your start-up and you don’t comply with it?Will theyinvest despite the risk that regulators might impose significant monetarypenalties on your start-up at some point in the future?Will they concludethat they don’t want to invest in your start-up because even if they requireyou to bring your start-up into compliance with the GDPR it will bedifficult to monetise their investment – whether by IPO or otherwise –when potential purchasers do their due diligence and discover the pastregulatory failures that may still lead to enforcement action and fines?What types of things should start-ups worry about from a data privacyperspective?The following things to worry about are the things that we see most often inour consulting practice.In your particular circumstances there may be more.■Product features and functionalitiesIf your start-up collects, monitors, processes or analyses personal data(such as call logs, contact lists, finance or health records, locationinformation, purchasing history, photos, CCTV footage) to provide aservice that you intend to monetise, there are data protection / privacyrules you will need to follow.Often, they don’t stop you from doing whatyou want to do, but they do have an impact on how you go about doing it.InMobi, a Singapore- and India-based start-up founded by Indiantechies was investigated by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) inJune 2016 for invading the personal privacy of individuals, includingchildren, by tracking their location even when they had opted out of thetracking feature.The purpose of the tracking was to provide advertisingbased on users’ locations.InMobi was subject to a US$4 million civilpenalty, which was lowered to US$950,000 “based on the company’sfinancial condition”, according to the FTC.The FTC ordered thecompany to delete all information it had collected from children and allinformation collected from adults who didn’t provide their consent to thetracking.The settlement also required InMobi to implement acomprehensive privacy programme that would be independently auditedevery two years for the next two decades.Sometimes, the data protection / privacy rules do stop you from doingwhat you want to do.And you’ll waste a lot of money – even if you don’tget fined – if you go ahead with something that you’re not allowed to do.Take the case of the smartphone application, Do No Evil, that was rolledout in Hong Kong and supplied personal data on individuals that itobtained from publicly available litigation and bankruptcy records.Itgrew to the point where it had more than 40,000 users who were makingmore than 200,000 requests for information.The Hong Kong PrivacyCommissioner investigated Do No Evil after receiving 12 complaints andmore than 60 inquiries about it and then issued an enforcement notice.Asa result of the enforcement notice, Do No Evil was closed down.So, you should be wary if your start-up collects, uses, discloses orstores information that enables the identification of an individual,■especially without their knowledge or consent, no matter how good ornoble your intention is.It also gets tricky if your service leveragesartificial intelligence, big data, predictive analysis or some form ofautomated decision-making or user-tracking – that’s not to say that youcan’t do it, but you need to be very careful about how you go about doingit.Security of your mobile or online applicationIf your start-up provides a mobile or online application, you need to takecare to make sure you don’t adopt poor encryption practices.Forexample:♦♦many applications do not encrypt data at all and many others encryptonly the parts of it that the developers feel need to be protected, suchas financial transactions or logins andsome applications don’t require user passwords or don’t encrypt alltraffic to their servers.Poor encryption practices mean that hackers can de-anonymise and takecontrol of user accounts by intruding on the non-encrypted traffic betweenyour start-up and the application.♦♦Besides poor encryption:a badly written Javascript interface may allow hackers to remotelyrun code and perform actions on behalf of a user without touching thedevice physically andmisconfiguration in the secure socket layer (SSL) may permit attacksthat compromise user details – this simply means any hacker canintercept the Internet connection, allowing what is often called a“man in the middle” attack.■Permissions sought by your mobile applicationsIf your start-up provides a mobile application, you need to take care tomake sure that the “permissions” that it seeks from users are notexcessive in relation to the purpose for which your start-up provides themobile application.You need to make sure that the developers have builtin only the permissions that you require.And you need to tell users inyour privacy policy the purpose for which those permissions arerequired.For example, if your mobile application is for scheduling onlinemeetings, a permission to access location data is likely to be excessive.But if it’s used to find particular places convenient to the user’s location,the permission to access location data is likely to be necessary.Youshould explain why – even if it’s obvious – in your privacy policy.All data protection laws require organisations, including startups, tofollow such rules.Users have a solid track record of making a big fuss ifthey feel that their personal data (such as information about theirlocation) is being collected “behind their back”.When we conducted a privacy and security survey of mobile■application in Singapore and Malaysia (see Chapter 17), we found that atthe time of the survey, more than 90% of all mobile applicationsbreached local data protection laws.The fact that such laws were newlyintroduced at the time of the survey may go some way towards explainingsuch a bad outcome.Marketing strategy and effortsMost start-ups promise aggressive marketing and customer acquisitionefforts and goals, especially to their investors, in order to meet variousfunding milestones.But we observe that many start-ups fail to understandthat there are privacy rules governing how organisations market to theirprospects and customers.One particular area that start-ups should takenote of are rules regarding sending unsolicited text messages withoutconsent.A new venture called Cab Guru offered a taxi booking app in the UK.It allowed users to compare fares and pickup times and then to book theirselected cab.Cab Guru sent 706,650 text messages during a one-daymarketing campaign.It used phone numbers provided by five of itsshareholders, but didn’t have the users’ consent to do so.This prompted165 complaints to be lodged with the Information Commissioner’s Office(ICO).Cab Guru was fined £45,000 by the ICO for breaki",,," Why is not having a DPO mandated for all organisations?

154,154,Data-sharing economy does not mean,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
155,155,sharing or processing any personal data,"indiscriminatelyA sharing economy is an economic system in which assets orservices are shared between private individuals, either free or for afee, typically by means of the Internet.Thanks to the sharingeconomy, you can easily rent out your car, your apartment, yourbike, even your wifi network when you don’t need it .—Dictionary.comIn a gig economy, temporary, flexible jobs are commonplace andcompanies tend toward hiring independent contractors andfreelancers instead of full-time employees .—InvestopediaThanks to the data-sharing economy made popular by companies such asUber and Airbnb, millions of service providers (supply) and users (demand)can now come together on these respective platforms to connect as well asexchange goods and services with one another to the benefit of both.Ride-sharing and apartment/home renting represent new ways of using data(including personal data) to provide services to people, when and wherethey want them – matching underutilised resources or unused capacity to meetjust-in-time demand.The good news is that it allows individuals to leverage the data-sharingeconomy to tap on new or additional sources of income.For example,someone who owns a car and has time to spare can benefit from ridesharingto be an Uber or Grab driver.Similarly, anyone with an extra room or unusedhome can get extra income from apartment or home renting withoutnecessarily relying on a real estate agent.The bad news is that by participating as a service provider in what isalso known as the gig economy, you are subject to data protection laws andrules.And that means that you can get into trouble with the law if you are notcareful with how you handle the personal data in your hands.Here are some cases where Uber drivers and Airbnb home providersraised eyebrows, potentially flouting privacy rules.Creepy actions that freak passengers outImagine getting text messages from an unknown sender after taking a Uberride.No big deal, you might say.What if you were Maria Ozawa, a formeradult film star, and the sender told you that he got your mobile phone numberfrom a Uber driver and sent you the following message, “Sorry.I just want toknow your name.And things you like.Hope you won’t get mad.”Notsurprisingly, Ms Ozawa slammed the driver’s unprofessional behaviour ofsharing her mobile phone contact without consent, in a Facebook post.1 Thishappened in the Philippines.In another case where a female passenger’s privacy was invaded, anUber driver developed a crush on the passenger after she rode in his car.Andbecause he knew where she lived, he sent her a bouquet of flowers with thefollowing note: “[Name redacted] it was a wonderful pleasure meeting youyesterday.I hope your day went well and I would love to take you out fordinner at Gyu Kaku Japanese BBQ Brookline.”2The above examples involve the sharing or disclosing of personal datawithout the consent of the individuals concerned as well as the use of theirpersonal data for unauthorised purposes.These are clear violations ofcommon principles under many data protection laws around the world.The affected passengers have rights under prevailing data protectionlaws to lodge complaints to the relevant regulatory authorities.The culprits may get into trouble for breaching privacy or data protectionrequirements under the law, in addition to violating Uber’s privacy policy.Secret surveillance of home rentersWhen staying in a hotel, would you expect to be watched by CCTV camerasin the privacy of your own room?Of course not.Well, the same logic applieswhen you rent someone’s room or apartment.Unfortunately, the following incident happened to a couple who rented anapartment in Irvine, California, from 16 December 2013 through 12 January12 2014, via Airbnb.During their stay, they discovered to their horror thatthe owner had placed a hidden video camera – with a wide-angled lens thatcould be controlled remotely – behind a bookshelf in the living room.As a result, Yvonne Schumacher of Germany filed a lawsuit againstAirbnb as well as the owner of the apartment in question.The complaintincluded the following: “Notably, while staying as a guest in the property, atnight Mrs. Schumacher would sleep without any clothing, believing that withthe front door closed and the window blinds drawn throughout the property,she was protected from prying eyes.This natural presumption proved to beincorrect.”3As the master bathroom was filthy, Mrs Schumacher used the bathroom inthe guest room, and she would walk naked through the apartment from themaster bedroom to the guest bathroom.In doing so, she walked within fullview of the property’s living room, and her movements were captured by thehidden video camera.The lawsuit also articulated that Mrs Schumacher and her male partner,Stockton, held many personal conversations in the living room, includingdiscussions concerning the nature of their relationship, as well as other moreintimate topics that couples are prone to talk about in private.If an incident like this were to happen in a country with data privacylaws, the data protection authority would likely investigate both Airbnb andthe owner of the apartment for breaching transparency and notificationprinciples.Under data protection regulations, any controller or organisationusing a video camera for surveillance must notify individuals beingmonitored of its specific purposes.And these individuals have the right toaccess any video footage that has captured their images.Rules that need to be followed by service providers in the data-sharingeconomyThe above cases demonstrate that as a service provider leveraging thebenefits of the data-sharing economy, you need to respect the privacy of yourcustomers – particularly in countries with data protection laws.Failure to doso may cause your account to be terminated, but more importantly, you couldbe fined or even receive a jail term for breaching the law, in addition tohaving legal proceedings against you.■■■■Here are a few basic rules to follow:Only use personal information received from your data-sharing platformprovider for the purposes of performing the intended service.Never usepersonal data for any purposes not authorised by the service or withoutconsent being given by the customer.Never disclose or share personal information you have obtained in atransaction with any unauthorised persons.Keep information confidentialand never disclose it to any family, friends or unauthorised personnel.Resist the temptation to share information pertaining to celebrities orVIPs who use your service.Protect any personal information you obtain and ensure that it is keptsecure.When using video cameras in your car or your home for the purpose ofsurveillance, ensure your passengers or home renters are aware of theirspecific use (e.g. for the safety of customers, as safeguards againstcomplaints).The cameras should never intrude on their privacy (as seenin the above cases).Audio recordings and video footage should never beused for any other purposes without the knowledge of those involved, nomatter what good intentions you may have.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIf you intend to derive a new source of income by providing ride-sharing, apartment/homerental services, or any other data-sharing services, here are a few key considerations foryou to successfully earn your gigs without breaching any data protection laws:■■■■■■Respect the privacy and the rights of your customers to protect their personal data.Read and honour the terms and conditions of the data-sharing platform you are using(especially the privacy requirements).Only use personal information received from your data-sharing platform provider for thepurposes of performing the intended service.Never disclose or share personal information you have obtained in a transaction with anyunauthorised person.Protect and secure any personal information in your care.Notify your customers if you are using a video camera for the purpose of surveillance.123http://entertainment.inquirer.net/258407/maria-ozawa-slams-tnv-drivers-stalking-sharing-personal-number-i-love-ph-but-people-are-so-unprofessional#ixzz55LjZocR0https://www.someecards.com/news/so-that-happened/uber-driver-bouquet-of-flowers/http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-1218-airbnb-lawsuit-20151217-story.html

156,156,Charities and other non-profit,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
157,157,organisations – doing good is not good,"enoughCharities of all types do a lot of good work, helping the community, helpingindividuals.So do various types of associations, whether they areorganisations that bring together people in the same business or professionalarena or sporting bodies that co-ordinate and promote their particular sportand related activities.Churches, too, unquestionably bring people togetherand do good work for such people and the community generally.Other non-profit organisations devote their time and effort to working for the good ofpeople who are disadvantaged in various ways, for the good of animals, forthe good of the environment, and for a host of other good causes.But is doing good, good enough?The notion that doing good is good enough – that financial resources arescarce and must be devoted to the cause for which money is raised – is anattitude that is not uncommon among individuals working for organisationsthat “do good”.Often though, organisations that “do good” also collect, use,disclose and store a great deal of personal data.It’s not good enough forthem to neglect their obligations under data protection / privacy laws.Hereare a few lessons about what happens if they do neglect those obligations.Non-profits, too, must secure their IT systemsThe Institution of Engineers Singapore1 is the national society of engineers inSingapore.Its functions include accrediting academic engineeringprogrammes, maintaining professional registries and promoting social,business, professional and career development amongst engineers inSingapore.It operates a website that includes both public pages and amembers’ portal.In October 2014, information on users of the site was hacked (by aperpetrator using cross-site scripting) and placed on a public website.Theregulator investigated the data breach and concluded that the organisation’sdata security measures were inadequate.Among other things, it had notprovided for encrypted storage of member passwords and had not conductedany penetration tests of its website.The regulator ordered it to pay afinancial penalty of S$10,000 and to do further work to secure its website (inaddition to what it had done during the course of the investigation).Non-profits, too, must take their data protection obligations seriouslyFailing to have proper data protection processesThe Alzheimer’s Society2 in the UK recruited 15 volunteers in 2007 to helpdementia sufferers and their families or carers seek National Health Service(NHS) healthcare funding.Between them, over a seven-year period, thevolunteers handled 1,920 cases.As part of their work, they drafted reportsincluding sensitive information about the medical treatment, care needs andmental health of the people they were trying to help.These volunteers usedtheir personal email addresses to receive and share such information, storedunencrypted data on their home computers and failed to keep paper recordslocked away.They were not trained in data protection, the charity’s policiesand procedures were not explained to them, and they had little supervisionfrom staff.The Head of Enforcement at the Information Commissioner’s Office(ICO), the data protection regulator in the UK, said in a press release on 7January 2016:In failing to ensure volunteers were properly supported, thischarity showed a disappointing attitude towards looking after thevery sensitive information that people trusted them with .Volunteers form the cornerstone of many charities’ work andwe all admire and appreciate their personal commitment andgoodwill.They play an important role and must be given thesupport to handle personal data as safely as paid members of staff.Anything less is unacceptable and, considering the vulnerability ofthe people who use the Society’s services, we have acted .Although the charity had made improvements since the shortcomings wereidentified in November 2014, the ICO issued it with an enforcement noticebecause it was concerned that more needed to be done.The Head ofEnforcement said:Our investigation revealed serious deficiencies in the way TheAlzheimer’s Society handles personal information.Some of thesehave been addressed, but the extent and persistence of the charity’sfailure to do as we’ve asked means we must now take more formalaction .As well as issues around the volunteers, the ICO said that the charity’swebsite had been hacked in 2015, putting at risk around 300,000 emailaddresses, 66,000 home addresses, phone numbers and some birth dates.Itmade a series of recommendations in the wake of the attack and the Societyimplemented most of them.But it did not undertake annual checks of itswebsite, a practice the ICO believed to be crucial in detecting vulnerability.The ICO had earlier made other recommendations that the charity hadfailed to implement fully.In 2010 the charity agreed to a series of securitymeasures after several unencrypted laptops were stolen during an officeburglary.And it had been the subject of two audits – in March 2013 andMarch 2014 – which made recommendations about data security.The enforcement notice issued by the ICO in January 2016 required theSociety to do all these things.The ICO said that if the Society failed tocomply with the enforcement notice it could face prosecution.The headline on the ICO’s webpage with the above information reads:“ICO criticises ‘disappointing attitude’ of dementia charity”.Ouch!That’s ahorrible headline for a charity that is busy doing good.Failing to protect personal dataThe British and Foreign Bible Society3 translates and distributes the Bible inthe UK and around the world, relying on donations from its UK supporters.On 31 May 2018, the ICO fined it £100,000 after its computer network wascompromised as the result of a ransomware attack in 2016.Between November and December 2016, the intruders into its IT systemused a brute force attack and exploited remote access that was only securedby a weak password.As a result, the attackers were able to access thepersonal data of 417,000 of the Society’s supporters.For more than 1,000 ofsuch supporters, some payment card and bank account details were placed atrisk.The ICO found that although the Society was the victim of a criminal act,it had failed to take appropriate technical and organisational steps to protectits supporters’ personal data.Charity fundraising enforcement actionsBetween 2015 and 2017, the ICO carried out an investigation into practicesin charity fundraising and some charities’ compliance with the laws thatprotect privacy and prevent nuisance phone calls.This resulted in 13charities – including many well-known and sometimes quite illustrious ones– being fined.4■Battersea Dogs and Cats Home was fined £9,000 for hiring a companyto find missing information and update out-of-date information in itsdatabase.These companies use existing information provided by donorsto track down new data or fill in the gaps.For example, they may use adonor’s old telephone number to find their new one or use an emailaddress to track down their postal address.Between 2011 and 2016,Battersea Dogs and Cats Home used this approach to try to find outinformation 740,181 times.What’s the problem here?Individuals have the right to choose what■personal information they provide and they are not obliged to update theirdetails with a charity if they don’t want to.Charities could use theadditional information they uncover, which the individuals do not knowthey have, to contact them for more money.Cancer Research UK was fined £16,000 for hiring a company to findmissing information and update out-of-date information in its databaseand for hiring a company to profile donors based on their wealth.Thesecompanies investigate income, property values, lifestyle and even aperson’s friendship circles in order to find the most wealthy and valuabledonors.They also identify donors they believe charities should targetbecause they are most likely to leave money in their wills – they call this“legacy profiling”.Between 2010 and 2016, Cancer Research UKwealth-screened 3,523,566 supporters and matched 678,887 telephonenumbers to supporters.What’s the problem with wealth profiling?Donors are oblivious to■this practice.If they don’t know it’s happening, they can’t object to it.Cancer Support UK was fined £16,000 for sharing data with othercharities through an external organisation that facilitates, in effect,charities swapping donor data with each other.Between 2010 and 2016,Cancer Support UK shared 3,075,550 donor records.This does notnecessarily reflect the number of individuals whose records were sharedas some may have been shared on more than one occasion.Organisationsthat the charity shared data with included lottery and prize promotioncompanies and a health supplements company.What’s the problem with sharing data?Donors are oblivious to this■practice, but it can result in a lot of unwanted charity marketing to them.The International Fund for Animal Welfare received a fine of £18,000– the largest among the charities investigated – for sharing data withother charities, for ranking donors according to their wealth and forfinding missing information/updating information.Between 2011 and2015, it shared 4,048,633 donor records (but the records of someindividuals may have been shared more than once).It ranked donorsbased on their wealth between 2007 and 2009, and in 2012 and 2013.The total number of individuals wealth-screened by the charity in 2012and 2013 was 466,206.Between 2006 and 2016, the charity matched220,286 telephone numbers to supporters, and matched 50,282 emailaddresses to supporters between 2012 and 2013.It also emailedsupporters without their consent.The other charities that were fined as a result of ICO’s investigation wereWWF-UK, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals(RSPCA), the British Heart Foundation (BHF), Oxfam, the National Societyfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), The Royal British Legion(RBL), Macmillan Cancer Support, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’sCharity, and the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association.Clearly, even big-name charities have to follow the rules like everyoneelse.Non-profits, too, must pay attention to their data handling practicesThe Singapore Computer Society5 promotes itself as the leading infocommand digital media professional society in Singapore.In 2015, it jointlyorganised and conducted an event with the then Infocomm DevelopmentAuthority (IDA) of Singapore.An employee of the society sent out an emailto all individuals who had registered for the event.A registration listcontaining personal data about all registrants was inadvertently attached tothose emails.This happened because the employee had used the “Forward”function when sending the emails to the registrants without first deleting theregistration list that was attached to the email she had received from hersupervisor.The regulator investigated and concluded that the society’s data handlingpractices in relation to sending the emails to the event registrants did notinclude sufficient security arrangements to the standard required by the dataprotection law.The regulator issued a warning to the society for its breach ofthe protection obligation under the data protection law.Credit Counselling Singapore6 is a social services organisation thatprovides assistance to debt-distressed individuals, such as credit counsellingand facilitating the establishment of a debt restructuring plan with creditors.While seeking to obtain updates from 96 clients in the organisation’sDebt Management Programme (DMP) the employee inadvertently pasted alltheir email addresses into the “To” field instead of the “Bcc” field.This notonly disclosed the email addresses of each individual to the 95 otherindividuals to whom the email was addressed, but also revealed to them thattheir debt situation was such that they were in the DMP, which the regulatorclassified as sensitive personal data.The regulator directed Credit Counselling Singapore to pay a financialpenalty of S$10,000.Lessons to be learnedDoing good is not good enough.Non-profit organisations must comply withdata protection / privacy laws in the same way as commercial, profit-makingorganisations are required to.Regulators will not hesitate to take actionagainst them, despite their good intentions – and even if their reasons forfailing to comply with applicable data protection / privacy laws may beconsistent with the good work they are doing.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures toprotect the personal data of donors, members and supporters, and ensure compliancewith local data protection / privacy laws.These include the following:■■■■■■■Secure IT systems (for example, use encryption methods, firewalls, secure passwords;conduct penetration tests of websites, etc).Train staff and volunteers on the organisation’s data protection policies and handlingprocedures.Refrain from profiling or ranking donors according to their wealth without their knowledge.Ensure fair collection of personal data and get opt-in consent for direct marketingactivities.Respect individuals’ rights to choose what personal information to provide when itcomes to updating their personal details.Do not attach registration or membership lists in emails without authorisation from yourorganisation or consent from the individuals concerned.Use the “Bcc” field instead of “To” or “Cc” when sending mass emails.123456See

158,158,"Data breach notification – to notify or not,",,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
159,159,that is the question,"Over 100 countries now have data protection / privacy laws.It has been saidrecently1 that most countries have stringent laws governing data breachnotification and that these laws mandate government, private organisationsand individuals who conduct business in any form to disclose any breach ofprivate, confidential customer information by unauthorised third parties.Let’s first unpack that statement in the specific context of data protection /privacy laws.What is a data breach?From a data protection / privacy perspective, we are talking about breachesthat involve personal data / personal information / personally identifiableinformation – the terminology varies from country to country, but the commonelement is that the term used always refers to data that is about or relates toan identifiable individual.It doesn’t extend to data about a “legal person”,such as a company; it covers individuals / natural persons / human beings.In the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a “personal databreach” is defined very broadly to mean:a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawfuldestruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or accessto, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processedThe common perception of a personal data breach is that it occurs whenpersonal data about individuals falls into the hands of a third party who is notentitled to have or receive it – that’s quite a bit narrower than the formalGDPR definition of a personal data breach, but it’s useful for the purpose ofdiscussing whether to notify or not.The more sensational cases of personaldata breaches relate to incidents attributed to “sophisticated cyberattacks”.However, their root cause is just as likely to be simple employeecarelessness or inattention or the actions of a “disgruntled insider”.Notify/disclose the breach to whom?And how quickly?A distinction needs to be made between:■■notifying a data protection / privacy regulator about a breach andnotifying the individuals – the data subjects – whose personal data hasfallen into the hands of third parties about a breach.In some countries, the data protection / privacy laws mandate both types ofnotification, at least in some circumstances – for example, where the breachinvolves more than a specified number of data subjects or a specified type ofpersonal data, such as sensitive personal data.In other cases, notification isvoluntary.Under the GDPR, for example, notifying the regulator is mandatory for allpersonal data breaches (with one exception); notifying the data subjects ismandatory only where a condition is met – namely, the organisation that is thedata controller must:■■“without delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours afterbecoming aware of it, notify the personal data breach, to the [relevant]supervisory authority … unless the personal data breach is unlikely toresult in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons” andwhere the data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights andfreedoms of natural persons, “communicate the personal data breach tothe data subject without undue delay”.Where notification of a data breach is mandated, 72 hours is a common time-frame.In some countries, there are detailed notification requirements; inothers, there is a basic requirement to notify the fact of a personal databreach, with little or no details about how and when this must be done.Consequences of a personal data / privacy breachWith one exception, in all countries that have data protection / privacy laws,personal data breaches constitute a failure to comply with theprotection/security obligation under such law.The exception arises if there isscope under the relevant law for the organisation (the data controller) toshow that the breach occurred despite it having taken all measures requiredby that law to prevent personal data breaches from occurring.For example, under the GDPR there is an obligation on both datacontrollers and data processors:Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementationand the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as wellas the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights andfreedoms of natural persons, … [to] implement appropriatetechnical and organisational measures to ensure a level of securityappropriate to the risk…Arguably, it follows that a personal data breach may occur despite the datacontroller or processor having complied with this obligation.Nevertheless,the data controller must satisfy the mandatory notification obligation outlinedabove. (Where a data processor suffers a personal data breach, the GDPRrequires it to notify the data controller without undue delay after becomingaware of it.)To notify or not to notify?That is the question.The question of whether or not to notify the supervisory authority does notcome up under the GDPR.The requirement is simple: It is mandatory,“unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights andfreedoms of natural persons.”But elsewhere?What approach shouldorganisations take?A best practice approachIn its Certified Information Privacy Manager (CIPM) course, theInternational Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) says that:■■notification is not always desirablewhere notification is not mandatory, organisations should considerwhether notification:♦♦will assist in preventing or limiting harm orcould simply result in unnecessary distress.In other words, the IAPP advocates an organisation assessing the likely riskof harm caused by the breach and then assessing the level of risk to relevantindividuals to make a decision whether or not to notify them about a databreach.Broad principles that might be consideredIn the US, the Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum (M-07-16) on 22 May 2007 headed “Safeguarding Against and Responding to theBreach of Personally Identifiable Information” in the possession of thegovernment.As part of the work of the Identity Theft Task Force, it requiredgovernment agencies to consider the following five factors when developinga data breach notification plan:1.2.3.4.5.The nature of the data elements breachedThe number of individuals affectedThe likelihood that the information is accessible and usableThe likelihood that the breach may lead to harmThe organisation’s ability to mitigate the risk of harmThe United States■Yahoo grabbed the headlines when it came to light in September 2016that it had “hidden” a data breach involving over 500 million useraccounts, despite knowing about it since December 2014.The exposedpersonal data may have included names, email addresses, telephonenumbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, securityquestions.It did not include unprotected passwords, payment card data orbank account information.It’s perfectly plausible that instead of “hiding” the data breach, thecompany applied the best practices and/or the broad principlesexpressed above and concluded that voluntary notification of the databreach was unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate.If so, that was aconclusion with dire consequences for Yahoo.First, in September 2016 a sale of Yahoo to Verizon was in the finalstages of negotiation.The news about the “hidden” data breachreportedly placed the sale in some doubt for a while.Ultimately, itreduced the sale price by US$350 million from the originally proposedUS$4.48 billion.Second, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)announced on 24 April 2018 that the shell company holding on to theremains of Yahoo after the sale to Verizon would have to pay a US$35million fine for failing to disclose the 2014 data breach.The companyagreed to the fine as part of the settlement of a charge that it misledinvestors by not informing them of the 2014 data breach until September2016.The SEC made it clear that public companies have additional■requirements to consider (as opposed to private companies) regardingnotification of data breaches.On 21 February 2018, the SEC issued apress release adopting a statement and interpretive guidance on publiccompany cybersecurity disclosures.2UnityPoint Health is a network of hospitals, clinics and home careservices in the US states of Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin.In April 2018,it admitted that a phishing attack compromised employee accounts andled to the exposure of the personal health information of 16,429 patients.UnityPoint Health said that it discovered the breach on 7 February 2018and determined that it had occurred between 1 November 2017 and 7February 2018.UnityPoint Health began notifying patients on 16 April 2018.It saidthat the information that may have been compromised included dates ofbirth, medical record numbers, treatment information, surgicalinformation, diagnoses, lab results, medications, providers, dates ofservice and insurance information.It noted that for a “limited number ofimpacted individuals”, their social security numbers may have beenexposed.A class action lawsuit was filed against UnityPoint Health on 4 May2018 alleging that it delayed reporting a healthcare data breach,incorrectly told affected patients that social security numbers were notpart of the breach and declined to compensate victims for damage to theircredit from the breach.This case raises the question of whether UnityPoint Health shouldhave notified patients of the breach when it first became aware of it on 7February 2018 – whether such a notification would have assisted inpreventing and limiting harm or would have simply resulted inunnecessary distress.The PhilippinesIn the Philippines, the personal information controller must notify theNational Privacy Commission (NPC) and affected data subjects when:■■personal information or other information that may, under thecircumstances, be used to enable identity fraud are reasonably believedto have been acquired by an unauthorised person andthe personal information controller or the NPC believes that suchunauthorised acquisition is likely to give rise to a real risk of seriousharm to any affected data subjects.So, there are two levels of subjectivity involved in this requirement.Let’ssee how it’s worked out in practice:■Wendy’s is an American fast-food chain that has been operating in thePhilippines since 1983.Now it is among the top 500 corporations in thePhilippines and operates 41 stores.On 23 April 2018, its website wasinfiltrated by “yet unknown persons” and over 80,000 records wereexposed.These included names, hashed passwords, home addresses,contact numbers, transaction details and modes of payment related tocustomers, as well as personal information about job seekers.3On 2 May 2018, the NPC issued an order to the personal informationcontroller to inform users affected by the data breach.The NPC hadconcluded that there was a real risk of serious harm to the data subjectswhose personal data had been stolen and then published online.The NPCasked the personal information controller to explain and defend why theNPC should not take further action against the occurrence of the breach,and also asked for the server logs, networks logs and traffic logs of theaffected website prior to the breach.The personal information controller notified data subjects by posting■an “Important Notification” on its website, which it shut down other thanfor posting such notice.It also sent text messages to affected datasubjects.Jollibee Foods Corp is the largest fast-food operator in the Philippines.On 8 December 2017, Jollibee notified the NPC that “persons unknown”to it appeared to have been able to gain access to the customer databaseof its delivery website.The NPC carried out an investigation andconcluded that the breach was the result of a proof-of-concept initiatedby a marketing PR team representative of Jollibee.Jollibee’s data protection officer (DPO) admitted that the databaseprotection was not up-to-date, including personal information not beingencrypted.The DPO also acknowledged difficulty in effecting the neededdata protection and security measures for various reasons, such asbudgetary constraints, low prioritisation or outright disinterest within theorganisation.On 8 May 2018, the NPC ordered Jollibee to suspend its onlinedelivery platform, together with all other data processing open to thepublic through the Internet and to restrict external access to Jollibee’snetworks indefinitely, pending the site’s identified vulnerabilities beingaddressed, as validated by a duly certified penetration-testingmethodology.♦♦♦♦The NPC also ordered Jollibee to:submit a security plan to be implemented in rehabilitating its systemto ensure the integrity and retention of its database and its consentwithin 10 calendar daysemploy Privacy by Design (PbD) in re-engineering its datainfrastructureconduct a new Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), considering thevulnerabilities exposed in the penetration tests andfile a monthly progress report on the matter until the issues raisedwere resolved.Conclusion: To notify or not?Clearly, where there is no mandatory requirement to notify relevant parties ofa data breach, there is no one-size-fits-all answer.Arguably, it is clear that an organisation should notify data subjects if bydoing so they will have an opportunity to protect themselves from adverseconsequences of the data breach.And, arguably, other corporate regulatorsand stock exchanges around the world would likely take the same position asthe SEC where news of a data breach may constitute “price-sensitiveinformation”.Whether an organisation can judge at the time of a data breachif it may be price-sensitive information at some time in the future and undercircumstances not envisaged at the time of the data breach is a separate, anddifficult, question.If, as is arguably likely to be the case, the approach taken by the NPC inthe Philippines is representative of other data protection / privacy regulators– including the supervisory authorities under the GDPR – organisations canexpect regulators to take firm action against them where they suffer a databreach whether or not notification was made.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations should:■■■■Be very sure that they understand what constitutes a personal data breach under anydata protection / privacy laws that apply to them.Definitions vary and may not requireexposure of personal data to a third party.Put a data breach response plan in place together with a response team, including ateam of experts such as a data forensics team, legal counsel and privacy experts.Know when mandatory notification of a data breach is required to be made by them.Develop an internal policy that covers at least the way in which they will decide whetherto make a voluntary notification of a personal data breach.123See “How to be compliant with data breach notification laws”, by Chris Low

160,160,Testing your organisation’s information,"security defences against data breachesA year has gone by since the two friends, A and B, discussed at length theconcepts of anonymity and pseudonymity at a beach resort (see Chapter28).Coincidentally, they meet again, of all places, at the top of a mountainthat is cut off from the rest of the world.Now that anonymity andpseudonymity are behind them, they can reveal their real identities – Aland Ben .Ben:Al:Ben:You know, Al, I’m pretty much alarmed by the increase in the numberof reported data breaches each year.And the number of people whosesensitive personal information was leaked or compromised is runninginto the hundreds of millions.Passwords, social security numbers,national identification numbers, payment card details, medicalinformation, etc, have been exposed.Are the hackers who caused thesedata breaches getting more sophisticated such that information securitydefences are having a hard time catching up with them?Ben, you should not give too much credit to the hackers.According toPonemon Institute’s 2017 Cost of Data Breach Study, 47% of databreaches involved a malicious or criminal attack, 28% were due tonegligent employees or contractors (human factor), and 25% involvedsystem glitches, including both IT and business process failures.Malicious attacks can be caused by external hackers or criminalinsiders (employees, contractors or other third parties).Negligentemployees are those who were careless in the way they handledsensitive personal information within the organisations.There werealso disgruntled employees who sabotaged their own organisations’ ITsystems and databases.So you are saying that the information security folks should not onlybuild defences to keep out the bad guys but also guard against theirAl:Ben:Al:Ben:Al:Ben:own employees?Precisely.In fact, according to PwC, 47% of the malicious attackers orfraudsters outside of the enterprise are considered “frenemies” –meaning they have a pre-existing relationship with the targetedcompany as a partner, supplier, service provider or customer.Thatmeans employees trusted these bad actors or complied with directionsthat led to a data breach.1Let’s assume that organisations can significantly reduce the proportionof negligent employees through more intentional education andawareness programmes on good information security practices.Thatstill leaves them with how to deal with malicious insiders and externalhackers.Education and awareness programmes on their own are not goodenough.Strong enforcement of the organisation’s information securitypolicies and processes by management is essential.And managementhas to lead by example and say what they mean by discipliningemployees who flout the internal policies.Okay, that’s well and good.So what measures can organisations taketo beef up their information security defences against maliciousinsiders and external hackers?First of all, organisations have to find out where the gaps and weakpoints in their information security defences are.VulnerabilityAssessment (VA), as the name suggests, is one technique that uncoversthe vulnerabilities in the organisation’s IT systems and networks andassesses their severity.Automated VA tools may be used to performthe vulnerability scans, flag out the vulnerabilities and present thefindings in a dashboard that is colour-coded according to the level ofseverity.Associated with each vulnerability is a list of recommendedactions to fix the shortcomings.For example, the VA report mayhighlight vulnerabilities such as weak passwords, unsecuredconnections to WiFi networks, or outdated anti-virus software.Thenthere will be recommendations on what to do next.Some automatedVA tools even have embedded utilities that provide the user with a setof guided instructions on how to fix the shortcomings.But that’s not enough, is it?No matter how good the automated VAtools are, they focus only on known or pre-defined vulnerabilities andhow to fix them.VA is not able to anticipate scenarios of how actualAl:Ben:Al:Ben:Al:hackers would exploit these vulnerabilities to hack into theorganisation’s IT systems and networks.It’s like getting someone toassess the security of your home based on visual inspection to identifythe vulnerabilities and then recommend how to fix the shortcomings.But you would not know how a determined burglar might work aroundthe vulnerabilities to break into the house unless you simulate a break-in, for example, by using special tools to unlatch the windows from theoutside and climbing into the house through the window.Ah, Ben, you’ve hit the nail on the head.Organisations need to do apenetration test (“pen test”) of their information security defences ifthey want to find out whether their security defences are strong enoughto keep out intruders.They can do a pen test by engaging a trusted,ethical hacker to try and hack into their IT systems and networks bytaking advantage of the vulnerabilities or by working around thevulnerabilities.The ethical hacker or so-called “white-hat hacker” (asopposed to a malicious “black-hat hacker”) is a highly skilled “techie”who thinks and behaves like an actual hacker, thus lending credence tothe adage: “It takes a thief to catch a thief”.So what actually takes place in a pen test?Does the white-hat hackertry to break into the “live” IT systems using whatever means or tools athis disposal?Isn’t this very intrusive?What if he disrupts the properfunctioning of the IT systems and affects the integrity of the data in thedatabases?Good, your concerns are coming fast and furious.Typically before apen test is launched, the organisation will define the scope of the test(for example, a web portal, a customer relationship managementsystem, a mobile app), the time window during which to carry out thetest (for example, during lull periods, so as to minimise businessdisruption), and the specific vulnerabilities to test.The white-hathacker is usually given strict instructions not to change any data orcontent in the systems.He is at most allowed to leave a tell-tale signor short message to announce that he has penetrated the website orapplication system.What does management hope to see at the end of a pen test?A pen test helps to identify vulnerabilities in web applications, mobileapps, internal devices, external-facing IP addresses and networks.Italso tests whether implemented controls work as designed.And if theBen:Al:controls fall short, it identifies what the gaps are and what more needsto be done.When is an appropriate time to do a pen test?It depends on the criticality of the IT systems and applications, and thelikelihood of data breaches.A pen test could be done quarterly, half-yearly or annually.It should be carried out under the followingscenarios:■■■■■when a data breach has occurred and new controls are put in placewhen security patches are appliedwhen there are significant changes to the network infrastructurewhen new infrastructure or web applications are implementedwhen there is a relocation of the data centre or server roomBen:Al:Ben:Al:I’m more enlightened now.Remember we spoke earlier about threatsto an organisation’s information security defences as coming from bothexternal hackers and malicious insiders.I guess pen tests are able toaddress the threats from external hackers, but not malicious insiders,right?Information security defences are designed to prevent outsidersfrom hacking into the organisation’s systems to steal information, butthey may not be designed to prevent insiders (with legitimate accesscredentials) from sending information out of the organisation.What doyou say to this?The organisation may have to use different tactics to safeguard againstinsider threats.One popular preventive measure is the use of data lossprevention (DLP) solutions to monitor the flow of data within theorganisation’s networks.DLP software is able to detect and blocksensitive, confidential or proprietary information belonging to theorganisation from being transmitted outside its security perimeterwithout authorisation.It goes without saying that the effectiveness ofthe DLP software in preventing data leakage depends on how well theorganisation defines its business rules for screening and filtering thedata.Wow, thanks, Al.I have learned so much from you this afternoon aboutthe different approaches to testing organisations’ information securitydefences against data breaches.My pleasure, Ben.Your stimulating questions have forced me toreinforce my own understanding of using vulnerability assessment,penetration testing and data loss prevention in practice.Ben:Al:It’s a good thing we are disconnected from cyberspace in these remotemountains.Otherwise we would have to worry about someone tryingto hack into our computing devices.Enjoy these moments while wecan.Agree beyond a shadow of doubt!CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESOrganisations have to put their information security defences to the test regularly tosafeguard against data breaches from both external and internal threats.Some of therecommended measures are:■■■■Conduct education and awareness programmes on good practices of informationsecurity for employees.Strongly enforce the organisation’s information security policies and processes.Perform vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to strengthen the protection ofthe organisation’s IT systems and networks.Implement data loss prevention solutions to prevent sensitive, confidential or proprietaryinformation from being leaked out of the organisation.1https://securityboulevard.com/2017/12/know-how-to-avoid-cyber-attacks-by-minimizing-human-error/     97",,," What percentage of data breaches were due to tonegligent employees or

untrue, for example, you may beundergoing cancer treatment since you always wear a hat that covers yourwhole head?”“That’s bad!”Security versus privacy – who has the say?The above dilemmas constantly confront regulators, policy-makers andprivacy professionals alike as new technologies with the capability to “see”,“hear”, analyse, synthesise and infer personal information (whetheraccurately or erroneously) are deployed.At what point does security and lawenforcement cross the line into invasion of privacy or secret surveillance?For example, traffic police use very high-resolution cameras to catch driverswho use mobile devices while driving.That is law enforcement.But suchcameras also intrude into the privacy of passengers in the vehicles.That is aninvasion of privacy because it is not necessary for law enforcement.Ever more powerful tools are being developed and introduced for bigdata analytics and machine learning.At what point does providing targetedcustomer service cross the line into secret profiling?At what point does itgive rise to discriminating between individuals based on race, gender, age,etc?Worse, what if the profiling process is automated and the decisions madeabout individuals based on the profiles are also automated?What happens ifthere are mistakes or inaccuracies in the processing?For example, CCTVimagery mistakes an innocent person for a terrorist suspect due to anerroneous matching of profiles by facial-recognition software that is notdiscerning enough – that is, it accepts a good-enough match instead ofrequiring an exact match.The ramifications of such an error can be traumatic,or worse, for the individual.But such scenarios of mismatching of individual profiles are about tochange as more sophisticated and precise facial recognition systems comeinto existence.Face-Six, an Israeli company, has developed a facialrecognition software that can identify a single face from millions of people inthe database in less than one second.It is claimed that this software has anidentification accuracy of around 99% in a controlled environment1.Here are some examples of facial recognition technologies being triedout in various environments and settings around the world2:■■■As of the beginning of 2018, China is leading the world in trialling anddeploying facial recognition technologies.At fast-food restaurants,customers can pay for their food using facial recognition software that isalso able to remember and predict their food choices.At many themeparks, visitors can gain entry via facial recognition detection withoutrequiring an admission ticket.Retailers will soon be able to use facial recognition technology to collectpersonal characteristics of shoppers, such as their gender, age and facialfeatures, as well as their shopping habits.With such highly personaliseddata, retailers can target specific customers with products andadvertisements that closely match their preferences.In Norway, a pilot project is using facial recognition software to detectand track passengers from when they enter the airport terminal until they■board the plane.It is stated that the trial aims to smooth passengers’passage through the airport and to minimise queues.In its London-based innovation centre, Cubic Transportation Systems hasdeveloped a prototype for a FasTrak gateless system that does not requirecommuters to have a ticket.Instead, FasTrak uses facial recognition,palm vein scanning and object tracking in a bid to cut down queues.Technology companies have upped their ante in experimenting with andtesting facial recognition and other biometric technologies to identify andtrack individuals, with a high degree of success.These technologies havebecome more intrusive and can invade personal privacy, no matter how well-intentioned the objectives are behind the surveillance.In fact, we had a clientwho boasted about how they were using facial recognition software to greetcustomers by name as they entered their premises.The marketing personnelseemed surprised when we remarked that customers might find it “freaky”.There will also be concerns that such processing may be usedirresponsibly and indiscriminately for some other secondary purposeswithout the knowledge of the individuals affected.Can privacy policies andcontrol measures catch up with the advancement of such technologies?What should organisations doBefore organisations deploy surveillance technologies and profiling tools,they should first respect that individuals or data subjects impacted have theright to be informed that they are being tracked and allow them to exercisetheir privacy rights under the data protection / privacy law.This can befulfilled by ensuring privacy notices are displayed prominently at relevantdata collection points, such as the entrances to the areas being surveilled.Next, organisations should conduct data protection impact assessments(DPIAs) to identify the high privacy risks and the necessary controls toreduce or minimise these risks.If practicable, they should adopt a Privacy byDesign (PbD) approach so that the necessary controls are designed into thesystems and processes before they are implemented.Organisations should adhere to the principle of data minimisation, i.e.collecting just enough personal data for their business or operationalpurposes.In the privacy notice, they must inform their targeted data subjectsof the specific purposes for collecting, using or disclosing the latter’spersonal data.They must make sure that there is a lawful or legitimate reasonfor collecting, using or disclosing such data, or that there is explicit consentfrom the data subjects, particularly in the case of sensitive data.They shouldnot collect personal data “just in case” or “for future business purposes”,because most data protection laws typically advise against collecting morepersonal data than is necessary for the required purpose.Organisations should establish appropriate privacy policies and standardoperating procedures (SOPs) to ensure acceptable use of surveillanceequipment and profiling tools.They should communicate these policies andSOPs to relevant employees and users so that they do not stray beyond thedefined boundaries of acceptable use.They should also ensure that there isstrict compliance to these policies and SOPs, and that disciplinary action istaken against employees and users who violate them.Under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),organisations need to appoint a data protection officer (DPO) if:■■they process data requiring “regular and systematic monitoring of datasubjects on a large scale”they process, on a large scale, any special category of personal data (i.e.sensitive personal data).This includes data which reveals racial orethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs ortrade union membership, and data concerning health or an individual’ssex life or sexual orientation.It also includes genetic data and biometricdata for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual.A balancing act between security and privacyIt is a delicate balancing act between the need for security on the one handand the need for privacy on the other hand.This will become even morechallenging as more and more privacy-intrusive technologies andapplications are introduced.Importantly, security and privacy professionals,as well as policy-makers and regulators, should work together to raiseawareness among developers and users of such technologies andapplications.They should also advocate policies and measures to ensuresecurity objectives are met, not at the expense of privacy, but in harmonywith privacy considerations.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESThe use of surveillance technologies and profiling tools is creating security-privacydilemmas.Organisations that intend to deploy such technologies and tools should adoptthe following good practices:■■■■■■■■■Allow individuals to exercise their rights under the data protection law, such as the rightto be informed and to object to or restrict processing.Conduct data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) to identify the high privacy risksand the controls to reduce or minimise these risks.Adopt a Privacy by Design (PbD) approach before the systems and processes areimplemented.Adhere to the data minimisation principle, i.e. collecting just enough personal data forbusiness or operational purposes.Inform data subjects of the specific purposes for collecting, using or disclosing theirpersonal data.Ensure that there is a lawful or legitimate reason for collecting, using or disclosingpersonal data, or that there is explicit consent from the data subjects, particularly in thecase of sensitive data.Establish privacy policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensureacceptable use of surveillance equipment and profiling tools.Communicate the policies and SOPs to relevant employees and users, and enforcestrict compliance.Appoint a data protection officer (DPO) if applicable under the EU’s General DataProtection Regulation (GDPR) or other applicable data protection legislation.12Source: “Biometrics: Why

163,163,Automated decision-making and profiling,,,,,[],,,,,['What is nan?']
164,164,could get you into trouble,"Zack (not his real name), an entrepreneur, wanted to apply for a personalloan from a bank which he had an account with.He went to the bank’s webportal, filled in the online form with the necessary personal information andloan application details, and submitted it.A few minutes later, he received anautomated reply from the bank to inform him that his loan application wasrejected.Puzzled by the bank’s decision, Zack drove to the bank anddemanded to know from the bank why his loan application was rejected.Abank officer explained to Zack that the decision to reject his application wasmade automatically by the computer system based on certain qualifyingcriteria.Apparently, Zack had been flagged out by the computer as anundischarged bankrupt who had defaulted on his past loans and credit cardpayments with the bank!Further investigation by the bank officer revealedthat someone else’s banking transactions had been merged wrongly intoZack’s bank account.Zack’s daughter, Zill (not her real name), a fresh university graduate,applied to a number of companies for a job.Without exception, everycompany she applied to rejected her application without even giving her achance of an interview with the company’s human resource personnel orhiring managers.Frustrated, Zill called each company to find out the reasonwhy she was not shortlisted, even though her qualifications met, or evenexceeded in some instances, the requirements for the jobs advertised.Shereceived the same answer – her application had been rejected automaticallyby the computer system.Apparently she had lived for a few years in a“blacklisted” country and she belonged to a “less preferred” ethnic group.Feeling strongly that she was discriminated against, Zill complained to theregulator.The regulator stepped in and directed the companies to reconsiderthe automated decision made, this time with a human decision-maker.What’s the big deal?Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the world of (1) automated decision-making, where computer systems make decisions that affect individualswithout “a human in the loop”; and (2) automated profiling, where a detailedprofile of any individual can be constructed based on a set of attributes suchas personal characteristics, qualifications, occupations, hobbies, interests,preferences, likes and dislikes.Many large corporations such as banks, financial institutions, schools,hospitals and government agencies have already been using automateddecision-making systems to sieve individuals into those who qualify andthose who don’t qualify for their services, schemes or offerings.Forexample, banks and corporations use automated decision-making systems forroutine decisions such as filtering out loan applicants and job applicants,respectively (as in the two illustrations above).By doing so, theseorganisations can redeploy their staff to do higher value-added or morecomplex tasks where human decision-makers are still required.Many marketers have already been using automated profiling tools tosegment individuals according to their preferences so that they can bettertarget their customers with closer matching of goods and services to thecustomers’ needs, likes and dislikes.For example, marketers can sendtargeted advertisements to individual customers based on their keywordsearches in one of their search engines.A keyword search like “recedinghairline” could result in the customer being bombarded with a whole arsenalof advertisements for hair-growth products.Although automated decision-making and profiling have been around fordecades, one great concern of privacy regulators is the exponential increasein the amount of individuals’ personal data that single organisations areholding today.For example, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon andother online and social media players have in their possession hundreds ofmillions or even billions of individuals’ personal data.And through the useof big data analytics, artificial intelligence and sophisticated algorithms,these companies have built up vaults of detailed profiles of all theindividuals who use their products and services worldwide.Privacy regulators are obviously concerned about whether the abovecompanies have implemented the necessary measures and mechanisms tosafeguard the privacy of the massive number of individuals whose personaldata they hold.The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal clearly provedotherwise.In this scandal, a total of 87 million profiles of individuals weredisclosed by Facebook to Cambridge Analytica without the knowledge orconsent of the individuals concerned.Cambridge Analytica, a politicalconsulting firm, then used these profiles to support the Trump campaign in theUS presidential election of 2016.1The discovery of the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal has given anew meaning to unauthorised personal data disclosure.Not only was the rawdata of individuals exposed to a third party without the individuals’knowledge or consent, but also the profiles of the individuals that weregenerated by combining the data from various sources.The profiles thusgenerated could lead to wrong interpretations of the truth about theindividuals if one or more of the data sources were unreliable or inaccurate,or if certain approximations were made during the process of combining thedata.What should organisations be aware of?If your organisation plans to implement automated decision-making andprofiling systems or has already done so, here are five principles you shouldbe aware of:■■Respecting individual privacyFirst and foremost, you must put in place the necessary organisational,technical and physical measures and mechanisms to safeguard the privacyof the personal data that is held by your organisation.You should conducta Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) during the design stage ofthe automated decision-making and profiling system so that theappropriate privacy components are considered and included in thedesign.Transparency and opennessYou must inform the individuals concerned that the personal data theyprovide to your organisation will be subject to automated processing andprofiling.You must also inform them if their personal data and/or profileswill be disclosed to any third party and for what purpose. (Yourorganisation would not want to run afoul of any privacy or dataprotection law, as in the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal.)The notification to the individuals concerned should be in a form thatis easy to understand and unambiguous.Where applicable, you should■obtain “freely given” consent from them.You should not “force” them togive consent under any circumstances. (On the first day of implementationof the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on 25 May2018, a complaint was filed against Google, Facebook and twoFacebook subsidiaries, Instagram and WhatsApp, concerning the issue of“forced” consent.2)Individuals’ rightsYou should allow the individuals who have given you the consent forautomated processing and profiling to withdraw their consent at any timeupon request.Whenever an individual challenges the automated decision made■about him or her, your organisation must intervene with a humandecision-maker to review the automated decision made and override it ifnecessary (as in the example above of the job application).Under theGDPR, individuals can exercise the right not to be subject to a decisionbased solely on automated processing, including profiling, whichsignificantly affects them.Decision-making rulesThe quality and soundness of the decisions made by automated decision-making and profiling systems depend very much on the pre-programmeddecision rules – for example, under what conditions to accept or reject aloan application or job application.Your organisation should thereforehave clearly defined decision-making rules.But note that you cannotexpect these decision-making rules to cover all scenarios.In addition, the automated decision-making and profiling system■should have the ability to flag out exceptions where the human decision-maker needs to come in.The human decision-maker can then make adiscretionary decision based on the unique circumstances, which theautomated system cannot do.This new knowledge should then beincorporated into the automated system so that its range of decision-making capability can be extended over time.Accuracy of informationAutomated decision-making and profiling systems need accurateinformation about the individual so that wrong decisions that affect theindividual are not made inadvertently (as in the loan application exampleabove).There are two aspects to the accuracy of information: (1) the rawinput data must be accurate and verified to be accurate, as far aspracticable; (2) the data analytic tools or algorithms must be tested toensure that the profiles of individuals they generate are accurate.ConclusionAutomated decision-making and profiling systems are going to get morepowerful as more intelligent technologies are brought into the realm.Safeguarding the privacy of individuals’ personal data will becomeincreasingly challenging, especially when we consider the Internet of Things(IoT) and more sophisticated surveillance and tracking technologies.In orderto stay abreast of prevailing privacy and data protection laws, organisationsshould at least be aware of the five basic principles above and know how toapply them.CHECKLIST OF GOOD PRACTICESIn implementing automated decision-making and profiling systems, organisations shouldbe aware of the following five principles:■ Respecting individual privacy••Safeguard the privacy of the personal data held by the organisation.Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before system implementation.■ Transparency and openness••Inform individuals about the automated processing, profiling and disclosure of theirpersonal data.Obtain their “freely given” consent where applicable.■ Individuals’ rights••Allow individuals to withdraw consent.Allow individuals to exercise their right not to be subject to a decision based solely onautomated processing, including profiling.■ Decision-making rules••Have clearly defined decision-making rules.Have the system flag out exceptions where human intervention can come in.■ Accuracy of information••Ensure the raw input data is accurate.Ensure the data analytic tools and algorithms generate accurate profiles of individuals.12https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/23/17151916/facebook-cambridge-analytica-trump-diagramhttps://privacylawblog.fieldfisher.com/2018/first-complaints-under-the-gdpr-lodged-within-hoursFinal ThoughtsThere you have it – 99 potential privacy breaches that can get organisationsand individuals into trouble with the data protection law.These present risksto any organisation in terms of how personal data is collected, used,disclosed, stored or disposed of.One enforcement officer told us that he uses our book as a “bible” tofamiliarise himself with the many operational lapses that can happen withinan organisation.In a similar way, we hope that the book will be your biblefor operational compliance as you perform your role as a data protection orcompliance officer, and that it enhances your own privacy managementprogramme.The checklist of good practices we have included at the end ofeach chapter should serve as a useful guide for your standard operatingprocedures to address the risks and gaps you may find in your organisation.In fact, we have shared many ways individuals and organisations can beblind-sided in the area of data protection and privacy.Some of them seemobvious, once mentioned, but they are easily overlooked in practice,especially when we are busy.For example, losing files by leaving them on abus or in a café because you haven’t figured out a way of carrying themaround securely.Others are less obvious, such as knowing that there is a harddisk inside a multi-function device (that is, printer/scanner/fax/copiermachine) and removing it before getting rid of the machine.Some are easy tobuild into everyday processes – for example, repositioning computer screensand CCTV monitors on reception desks and security counters so thatpassersby can’t see personal data on them.Others require discipline and forall employees to play their part conscientiously.For example, securelytransferring confidential documents within an organisation or doing regularhousekeeping to get rid of personal data that no longer needs to be retained.Then there’s the impact of new privacy-invasive technologies relating toautomated decision-making, IoT profiling and surveillance, all of whichcould violate the privacy rights of individuals and lead to complaints toregulators.By looking in the rear mirror of past cases and raising some of our ownreal-life experiences, we sincerely hope we have convinced you that youneed a roadmap to your organisation’s operational compliance with new orstricter data protection laws now in place or on the horizon.We hope that wehave given you a clearer view of what to look out for.Relying on dataprotection policies to guide the organisation alone is not good enough.Withthese new insights on where the specific risk areas are, you can now go onestep further in designing standard operating procedures and codes of conductto proactively address such risks – especially among front-line staff.What’s next?To recap, instead of looking at compliance with the data protection law froma perspective of privacy principles, use an information life cycle approach.A life cycle approach includes the privacy principles but makes it easy tolook at them through an operational and therefore practical lens.It brings theprivacy principles to life as it traces the collection, use, disclosure andstorage/disposal of personal data in operational processes.From our experience, many of our clients have attended data protectioncourses that cover the technicalities of the privacy principles.The coursesgive participants the “what” of the data protection law.But we constantlyhear from our clients that they found it difficult to understand the legal termsused, let alone apply the principles to their daily work.The courses seem touse few, if any, examples and case studies of everyday business oroperational scenarios to address the myriad of lingering questions andpractical uncertainties to respond to “Now that I’ve finished this trainingcourse, what do I actually need to do?”Metaphorically speaking, even those who have learned and understoodthe data protection law have only been given the “appetiser” of what must bedone to comply with the law.We hope that this book provides the “maindish” of how to achieve operational compliance, beyond just legalcompliance, and helps to fill competency gaps.And we hope this book whetsyour appetite for more, that it makes you keen to apply a worldwide standardand framework in your privacy programme and operations.For you, theInternational Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) provides twouseful international certifications that provide data protection know-how –the Certified Information Privacy Manager (CIPM) qualification for dataprotection officers and compliance managers.And the Certified InformationPrivacy Technologist (CIPT) qualification for application developers aswell as infocomm or information security professionals.Both these usefulcertifications approach privacy from an information life cycle perspectiveand cover not just the legal aspects of data protection but also the practicaloperational aspects.More information about these courses and classroomtraining can be found on IAPP’s website at www.iapp.org.As a parting note, we would like to recommend what we fondly call theAPSR (Assess, Protect, Sustain and Respond) approach to help furthercomplement your efforts in achieving operational compliance, assuming youhave a governance structure already in place.This a useful and practicalprivacy operational life cycle, referenced in IAPP’s CIPM syllabus andfurther enhanced by Straits Interactive, which adopts a risk-based approachto helping organisations get compliant and stay compliant.The privacy operational life cycleThe first step in any organisation’s data protection programme is to put inplace its data protection committee.It may consist of stakeholders who headthe processing and are owners of personal data within your organisation.Itdetermines the scope of operations and the governance structure of your dataprotection programme.Then you are ready to adopt the APSR operational life cycle.AssessFirst, you should assess the possible risks relating to personal data in yourbusiness operations.You can do this by:■■taking a data inventory of all personal data in your care anddocumenting a data flow diagram of how personal data is collected,used, disclosed, stored and disposed of within each department.This should identify for you all the threats affecting each stage of theinformation life cycle and the organisation’s vulnerabilities that are beingexploited by those threats – the so-called gap analysis.In this book we have presented you with 99 potential privacy breachesthat can happen to any organisation, many of which could be applicable toyours.In the following diagram, we have summarised 40 potential exposuresto look out for:Next, identify:■■the privacy framework that applies to your organisation and that guidesyour privacy operations – that is, your local data protection law – andyour organisation’s regulatory risks, gaps and exposures – that is, do adata protection or privacy impact assessment1.The privacy impact assessment should also take into consideration the risks,gaps and exposures you have identified earlier.Once you have done thenecessary activities, you are now ready for the next step.ProtectIn this phase, you will need to address the risks, gaps and exposuresidentified in the data protection or privacy impact assessment.You do this bydeveloping policies, guidelines and actions that need to be taken.In order tobe effective, these should be a combination of administrative, physical andtechnical measures.The checklists of good practices we have provided at the end of eachchapter in this book will serve as a useful guide.Find the chapters that arerelevant to your operations, but do take note that they have to be tailored toyour organisation’s unique circumstances.The most effective measures arethose which are aligned with and embedded in the operating processes ofyour organisation so that there is employee ownership, responsibility andaccountability.Remember, the good practices and measures will need to be formallydocumented in your internal data protection and information securitypolicies.In turn, your employment contracts should require employees tocomply with all your internal policies, with disciplinary consequences if theyfail to do so.With this combination, compliance with your internal policiescan be enforced.SustainThis phase is beyond the scope of this book.It involves monitoring, auditingand communicating data protection practices in the organisation.In our experience, many organisations stop at the Protect stage.Theproblem here is that the required policies and practices are quickly forgottenafter the compliance project is over or after the privacy taskforce has met itsobjectives.Organisations, especially those new to data protection, hardlymonitor any regulatory changes and metrics of whether the controls havebeen effectively implemented.Because there are no continuing education and awareness programmes oreven audits of the organisation’s policies and practices, the organisationremains susceptible to the breaches we have identified in this book due topoor implementation and shallow awareness.RespondFinally, this phase ensures that the organisation can effectively respond tocomplaints, inquiries, or data subject requests.In the worst-case scenario,there could be data or privacy breaches which require a formal breachresponse plan to be executed.If there are any such incidents, the organisationmust investigate and prevent any further harm from happening.If there is aprobe by the regulator, a critical factor is to demonstrate accountability andprovide evidence that the organisation has done everything possible toprevent the incident from happening.For those organisations starting their compliance efforts from scratch orlooking at improvements to make, a good accountability framework toconsider is the Nymity Privacy Management Accountability Framework.(This is especially so if your organisation operates in multiple jurisdictionswith data protection laws.)It sets out 13 high-level processes that describehow to implement a comprehensive data protection programme.Then itprovides a number of proactive activities to choose from – use some or all ofthem – in terms of regulatory measures organisations should take to track andmonitor compliance.As can be seen, one cannot underestimate the amount of work needed toensure operational compliance with the data protection law.That is why weat Straits Interactive have created an integrated software platform based onthe APSR framework to assist our clients to manage and sustain theircompliance efforts in the shortest time possible.We use this same platform totrain and enable our clients, much to their appreciation, as it helps enhanceautomation, collaboration and productivity.Called the Data ProtectionManagement System (DPMS), you can view a video-clip of it atwww.dataprotectionmgmt.com/bookAt the end of the day, having a mature data protection and privacymanagement programme that supports operational compliance should helporganisations justify investment in such a programme.It provides them with acompetitive edge over competitors and increases client trust compared withcompetitors that have only a laissez-faire approach to their clients’ privacy.Besides assurance, improved standards of information justify lowerpremiums in cyber-insurance – protection which every organisation shouldconsider to manage its information security risk.In conclusion, the following quote reflects the reality of data privacytoday that all organisations and individuals covered by the data protectionlaw should recognise:When it comes to privacy and accountability, people alwaysdemand the former for themselves and the latter for everyone else.212Refer to the diagram in the Introduction where we mapped the general data protectionprinciples within the information life cycle for your convenience.Quote from Glen David Brin, an American scientist and award-winning author of sciencefiction.AcknowledgementsWhen we first proposed this book, the title was 50 Privacy Breaches .By thetime we completed the first edition of the book back in 2016, the number hadgrown to 88.We had to convince our publisher, Marshall Cavendish, thatthere was a need for such a book.When the General Data ProtectionRegulation (GDPR) came into force on 25 May 2018, it was the other waywith this second edition.Marshall Cavendish were the ones pushing us tosubmit the new chapters. “We’ll be going to print asap, the world has beenwaiting for this update :)”, as our editor aptly put it.We have been very fortunate to be at the right place at the right time tomake this happen, being connected with privacy professionals, dataprotection officers, legal counsels and solution-providers, both locally andglobally.The highly publicised breaches, combined with both theintroduction and enforcement of new and existing data protection lawsrespectively, have also heightened the awareness and importance of privacy.As consultants, our work in providing advisory services, audits, trainingand system implementation relating to data protection in Singapore,Malaysia, Philippines and the region, working together with their respectiveEuropean or regional headquarters, has also given us the opportunity to learnfrom our clients and course participants.In addition, by referring to casenotes published by privacy commissions around the world, we have beenable to articulate fairly comprehensive checklists to accompany each chapter.This was also helped by the informal consultations and discussions we hadwith officials and investigators from the data protection commissions inSingapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.Hence, we wish to thank the following people and organisations for theircontributions to our inspiration and knowledge, and for their help in creatingthis book:■ Staff and consultants with Straits Interactive, especially Alvin Toh,William Lim, Celine Chew, Angela Schooling, Wong Mei Kwan, Azhar■■■■■■■■■■■■Azib, Andrew Fam,
