78,,,,"When relying on deemed consent by notification, what does an organistion need to do?",,What is Section 15A of the PDPA?,"a)Conduct an assessment to eliminate or mitigate adverse effects: Section 15A(4)(a) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must, before collecting, using or disclosing any personal data about an individual, conduct an assessment to determine that the proposed collection, use or disclosure of personal data is not likely to have an adverse effect on the individual. The assessment for relying on deemed consent by notification will also have to take into consideration the method of notification and opt-out period (see paragraphs 12.23(b) and (c)). Apart from identifying the likely adverse effects, the organisation’s assessment should consider any measures to be taken by the organisation to eliminate, reduce the likelihood of or mitigate the adverse effects identified. Organisations may wish to use the Assessment Checklist for Deemed Consent by Notification (at Annex B) to conduct the assessment. Please refer to the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2021 and paragraphs 12.64 – 12.69 below on conducting the assessment.
b)Organisation must take reasonable steps to ensure that notification provided to individuals is adequate: Section 15A(4)(b) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must take reasonable steps to bring the following matters to the attention of the individual: (i) the organisation’s intention to collect, use or disclose the personal data; (ii) the purpose of such collection, use or disclosure; and (iii) a reasonable period within which, and a reasonable manner by which, an individual can opt out of the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data for this purpose. The Commission does not prescribe the method by which the individual should be notified, but the organisation must ensure the notification is adequate and effective in making the individual aware of the proposed collection, use or disclosure of his personal data . Organisations may choose to rely on a single mode or multiple modes of communication in notifying individuals adequately. Some considerations for determining the appropriate mode(s) of communication   include:
(i) The usual mode of communication between the individual and the organisation.
(ii) Whether direct communication channels such as mail, email messages, telephone calls or SMS10 are available. Notification provided through interactive portals and applications may also be considered. These could include push notifications sent through mobile applications. These also include dashboards or consent portals where individuals can keep track of their interactions with the organisation, including their preferences on purposes for which they consent to the collection, use or disclosure of their personal data. However, organisations should note that these channels may not always be effective (e.g. contact information may not be updated).
(iii) Number of individuals to be notified. In particular, where the organisation intends to reach out to a large number of individuals, and assesses that direct communication channels are not effective, other forms of mass communication channels may be considered. These include a micro-site on the organisation’s corporate website, notification through the organisation’s social media channels, and notifications through printed or other news media.
c)Organisation must provide a reasonable opt-out period: The organisation must provide a reasonable period for the individual to opt out before it proceeds to collect, use or disclose the personal data. Consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data is deemed to be given only after the opt-out period has lapsed. Any collection, use or disclosure of personal data for the purposes that have been notified should commence only after the expiry of the opt-out period. Deemed consent by notification should not be relied on where individuals would not have a reasonable opportunity and period to opt out (e.g. security monitoring of premises using video cameras). The Commission does not prescribe a specific opt-out period, and organisations shall assess and determine a reasonable period for individuals to opt out of the collection, use or disclosure of personal data. Some considerations for determining the reasonableness of the opt- out period include:
(i) The nature and frequency of interaction with the individual. For instance, where an organisation sends push notifications through a mobile application used by individuals to track and update monthly medical check-up information, the opt-out period should not be shorter than one month.
(ii) The communications and opt-out channels used. Direct communications channels, particularly those that have a track record of being effective in reaching the intended customer base, may justify a shorter opt-out period than mass communications channels. Opt-out methods that are easily accessible and easy to use may also justify a shorter opt-out period (e.g. providing for opt-out via email or hyperlink).","a)Conduct an assessment to eliminate or mitigate adverse effects: Section 15A(4)(a) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must, before collecting, using or disclosing any personal data about an individual, conduct an assessment to determine that the proposed collection, use or disclosure of personal data is not likely to have an adverse effect on the individual.

Organisations may wish to use the Assessment Checklist for Deemed Consent by Notification (at Annex B) to conduct the assessment. Please refer to the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2021 and paragraphs 12.64 – 12.69 below on conducting the assessment. b)Organisation must take reasonable steps to ensure that notification provided to individuals is adequate: Section 15A(4)(b) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must take reasonable steps to bring the following matters to the attention of the individual: (i) the organisation’s intention to collect, use or disclose the personal data; (ii) the purpose of such collection, use or disclosure; and (iii) a reasonable period within which, and a reasonable manner by which, an individual can opt out of the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data for this purpose. The Commission does not prescribe the method by which the individual should be notified, but the organisation must ensure the notification is adequate and effective in making the individual aware of the proposed collection, use or disclosure of his personal data . Organisations may choose to rely on a single mode or multiple modes of communication in notifying individuals adequately. Some considerations for determining the appropriate mode(s) of communication   include:\n(i) The usual mode of communication between the individual and the organisation. (ii) Whether direct communication channels such as mail, email messages, telephone calls or SMS10 are available. Notification provided through interactive portals and applications may also be considered. These could include push notifications sent through mobile applications. These also include dashboards or consent portals where individuals can keep track of their interactions with the organisation, including their preferences on purposes for which they consent to the collection, use or disclosure of their personal data. However, organisations should note that these channels may not always be effective (e.g. contact information may not be updated). (iii) Number of individuals to be notified. In particular, where the organisation intends to reach out to a large number of individuals, and assesses that direct communication channels are not effective, other forms of mass communication channels may be considered. These include a micro-site on the organisation’s corporate website, notification through the organisation’s social media channels, and notifications through printed or other news media. c)Organisation must provide a reasonable opt-out period: The organisation must provide a reasonable period for the individual to opt out before it proceeds to collect, use or disclose the personal data. Consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data is deemed to be given only after the opt-out period has lapsed. Any collection, use or disclosure of personal data for the purposes that have been notified should commence only after the expiry of the opt-out period. Deemed consent by notification should not be relied on where individuals would not have a reasonable opportunity and period to opt out (e.g. security monitoring of premises using video cameras). The Commission does not prescribe a specific opt-out period, and organisations shall assess and determine a reasonable period for individuals to opt out of the collection, use or disclosure of personal data. Some considerations for determining the reasonableness of the opt- out period include:\n(i) The nature and frequency of interaction with the individual. For instance, where an organisation sends push notifications through a mobile application used by individuals to track and update monthly medical check-up information, the opt-out period should not be shorter than one month. (ii) The communications and opt-out channels used. Direct communications channels, particularly those that have a track record of being effective in reaching the intended customer base, may justify a shorter opt-out period than mass communications channels. Opt-out methods that are easily accessible and easy to use may also justify a shorter opt-out period (e.g. providing for opt-out via email or hyperlink).', 'questions': [{'question_statement': 'Who must take reasonable steps to ensure that notification provided to individuals is adequate?', 'question_type': 'MCQ', 'answer': 'organisation', 'id': 1, 'options': ['Ngo', 'Org', 'Actual Organization'], 'options_algorithm': 'sense2vec', 'extra_options': ['Institution'], 'context': 'b)Organisation must take reasonable steps to ensure that notification provided to individuals is adequate: Section 15A(4)(b) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must take reasonable steps to bring the following matters to the attention of the individual: (i) the organisation’s intention to collect, use or disclose the personal data; (ii) the purpose of such collection, use or disclosure; and (iii) a reasonable period within which, and a reasonable manner by which, an individual can opt out of the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data for this purpose. b)Organisation must take reasonable steps to ensure that notification provided to individuals is adequate: Section 15A(4)(b) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must take reasonable steps to bring the following matters to the attention of the individual: (i) the organisation’s intention to collect, use or disclose the personal data; (ii) the purpose of such collection, use or disclosure; and (iii) a reasonable period within which, and a reasonable manner by which, an individual can opt out of the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data for this purpose. b)Organisation must take reasonable steps to ensure that notification provided to individuals is adequate: Section 15A(4)(b) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must take reasonable steps to bring the following matters to the attention of the individual: (i) the organisation’s intention to collect, use or disclose the personal data; (ii) the purpose of such collection, use or disclosure; and (iii) a reasonable period within which, and a reasonable manner by which, an individual can opt out of the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data for this purpose.'}, {'question_statement': 'What is the purpose of the collection, use or disclosure of personal data?', 'question_type': 'MCQ', 'answer': 'disclosure', 'id': 2, 'options': ['Disclaimer', 'Recusal'], 'options_algorithm': 'sense2vec', 'extra_options': [], 'context': 'b)Organisation must take reasonable steps to ensure that notification provided to individuals is adequate: Section 15A(4)(b) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must take reasonable steps to bring the following matters to the attention of the individual: (i) the organisation’s intention to collect, use or disclose the personal data; (ii) the purpose of such collection, use or disclosure; and (iii) a reasonable period within which, and a reasonable manner by which, an individual can opt out of the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data for this purpose. b)Organisation must take reasonable steps to ensure that notification provided to individuals is adequate: Section 15A(4)(b) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must take reasonable steps to bring the following matters to the attention of the individual: (i) the organisation’s intention to collect, use or disclose the personal data; (ii) the purpose of such collection, use or disclosure; and (iii) a reasonable period within which, and a reasonable manner by which, an individual can opt out of the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data for this purpose. a)Conduct an assessment to eliminate or mitigate adverse effects: Section 15A(4)(a) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must, before collecting, using or disclosing any personal data about an individual, conduct an assessment to determine that the proposed collection, use or disclosure of personal data is not likely to have an adverse effect on the individual.'}, {'question_statement': 'What is the process of collecting, using and disclosure of personal data?', 'question_type': 'MCQ', 'answer': 'consent', 'id': 3, 'options': ['Consensual Sex'], 'options_algorithm': 'sense2vec', 'extra_options': [], 'context': 'These also include dashboards or consent portals where individuals can keep track of their interactions with the organisation, including their preferences on purposes for which they consent to the collection, use or disclosure of their personal data.

104,,,,What needs to be done when relying on the legitimate interest exception?,,,"As the legitimate interests exception allows the collection, use or disclosure of personal data without consent for a wide range of circumstances and purposes, the onus is on the organisation seeking to rely on this exception to comply with additional safeguards to ensure that the interests of individuals are protected. Organisations must assess that they satisfy the following requirements before relying on the legitimate interests exception:
a) Identify and articulate the legitimate interests. Organisations must identify and be able to clearly articulate the situation or purpose that qualifies as a legitimate interest.
b) Conduct an assessment. Paragraph 1(2)(a) read with paragraph 1(3) under Part 3 of the First Schedule, provides that an organisation must conduct an assessment before collecting, using or disclosing personal data (as the case may be) to (i) identify any adverse effect that the proposed collection, use or disclosure is likely to have on the individual; and (ii) identify and implement reasonable measures to eliminate, reduce the likelihood of or mitigate the adverse effect on the individual. Where it is assessed that there is likely residual adverse effect to the individual after implementing the measures, organisations are required to conduct a balancing test as part of the assessment to determine that the legitimate interests of the organisation or other person (including other organisations) outweigh any likely residual adverse effect to the individual.

Organisations may rely on the legitimate interests exception if the legitimate interests outweigh any likely residual adverse effect to the individual.",,,Example,Binary,,,,
117,,,,"In determining the likely adverse effect on the individual, the organisation should consider the following:",,,"a)The impact of the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data on the individual: Organisations are required to assess both the severity and likelihood of any adverse effect that may arise from the collection, use or disclosure of personal data. The assessment referred to in these Guidelines requires an assessment of all reasonably foreseeable risks and adverse effect to the individual resulting from the intended collection, use or disclosure. In general, the more severe the adverse effect of the collection, use or disclosure to the individual, the more unlikely the benefits of the collection, use or disclosure would outweigh the likely adverse effect. Please refer to paragraph 12.65 on adverse effect.  
b) The nature and type of personal data and whether the individuals belong to a vulnerable segment of the population: In general, the potential adverse effect to individuals will be higher if the personal data is sensitive in nature. Organisations should also consider the individuals to whom the personal data relate, and whether they belong to a vulnerable group such as minors, individuals with physical or mental disabilities, or other special needs. The adverse effect may be more severe if the individuals belong to a vulnerable segment of the population.
c) The extent of the collection, use or disclosure of personal data and how the personal data will be processed and protected: Organisations should consider how extensive the collection, use or disclosure of an individual’s personal data will be, and how the personal data will be collected, used or disclosed (e.g. whether collection is one-off or on a continuous basis). Organisations shall ensure that they do not collect, use or disclose more personal data than is reasonably necessary in order to achieve the purpose. For instance, collection of more types of data about an individual is likely to have a higher risk and adverse effect than collection of only specific types of personal data. How the personal data is protected, such as the implementation of access controls to prevent any unauthorised access, use or disclosure, may also affect the likelihood of adverse effect to the individuals.
d) Reasonableness20 of the purpose of collection, use or disclosure of personal data: Organisations should ensure that the purpose of the collection, use and disclosure of personal data is proportionate and appropriate in the circumstances. In general, the context should be considered when assessing the reasonableness of purpose. For example, when using or disclosing personal data for a secondary purpose, organisations may wish to consider the primary purpose and how the personal data was collected, and whether it affects the reasonableness of using or disclosing the personal data for the new purpose.
e) Whether the predictions or decisions that may arise from the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data are likely to cause physical harm, harassment, serious alarm or distress to the individual: Where the collection, use or disclosure of personal data is to make predictions or decisions about individuals, organisations should also consider prevailing social norms and practices that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in determining if the decisions are likely to result in unfair discrimination, physical harm, harassment, alarm or distress to the individual.","a)The impact of the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data on the individual: Organisations are required to assess both the severity and likelihood of any adverse effect that may arise from the collection, use or disclosure of personal data.

137,,,,"Which of the following is/are considered ""open to the public""?",,,"A location or event would be considered “open to the public” if members of the public can enter or access the location with few or no restrictions. Generally speaking, the more restrictions there are for access to a particular location, the less likely it would be considered “open to the public”. Relevant considerations would be factors that affect the ease and ability with which the public can gain access to the place. Examples include the presence or absence of physical barriers, such as fences, walls and gates, around the place; the conditions and effectiveness of these barriers; and the employment of security systems, sentries and patrols aimed at restricting entry. However, the mere existence of some restrictions is not sufficient to prevent the location from being regarded as open to the public. For example, events that may be entered only upon payment of a fee by a member of the public may be considered to be open to the public for the purposes of the PDPA. Similarly, special events for members of a retailer’s loyalty programme may also be considered open to the public, depending on relevant factors such as whether the event was open to a large number of members. The Commission recognises that there can be private spaces within public spaces. In some situations, a private event may be held at a location that is usually open to the public. For example, an individual may book an entire restaurant for a private dinner. In such situations, as members of the public cannot enter the location during the event, the event is not open to the public. In addition, a location is not open to the public merely because members of the public may look into the premises or location. For example, if members of the public are not able to enter residential premises or commercial premises that are closed for a private event, the ability to observe what is happening inside the premises would not make the premises open to the public. Another example would be the interior of a taxi for the duration when it is hired by a passenger. During the period(s) of hire, the interior of the taxi would not be considered a location that is open to the public, even though the taxi itself may be in a public space. The “publicly available data” exception may not apply to such private spaces within public spaces and an organisation must typically provide appropriate notification and obtain consent before collecting, using or disclosing personal data (e.g. in-vehicle video cameras which collect personal data of the passengers in a taxi)26.","A location or event would be considered “open to the public” if members of the public can enter or access the location with few or no restrictions.

In such situations, as members of the public cannot enter the location during the event, the event is not open to the public. In addition, a location is not open to the public merely because members of the public may look into the premises or location. For example, if members of the public are not able to enter residential premises or commercial premises that are closed for a private event, the ability to observe what is happening inside the premises would not make the premises open to the public. Another example would be the interior of a taxi for the duration when it is hired by a passenger. During the period(s) of hire, the interior of the taxi would not be considered a location that is open to the public, even though the taxi itself may be in a public space. The “publicly available data” exception may not apply to such private spaces within public spaces and an organisation must typically provide appropriate notification and obtain consent before collecting, using or disclosing personal data (e.g. in-vehicle video cameras which collect personal data of the passengers in a taxi)26.",,,Exception,selection,,,,
138,,,,"Charles wishes to organise a birthday party for his son David. Charles books a private room within a fast food restaurant for the occasion and invites twenty of David’s friends and their parents. The private room is right by the general dining area and the interior can be seen by other patrons through the glass windows. The fast food restaurant management puts up a sign at the entrance of the private room which says “Reserved for Private Event: David’s 8th birthday party”. Charles keeps the door closed at all times and keeps an eye on it to ensure that only invited guests enter. Is the birthday party  considered open to the public?

638,Case Study 1,"This section introduces Case Study 1, about which all questions will be asked.",,"11) Please use the following to answer questions 11-16:Country Fresh Sundries started in the kitchen of its founder Margaret Holmes as she made soap following a traditional family recipe.  It is a much different business today, having grown first through product placement in health and beauty retail outlets, then through a thriving catalog business.  The company was slow to launch an online store, but once it did so, the online business grew rapidly.  Online sales now account for 65% of a business which is increasingly international in scope.  In fact, Country Fresh is now a leading seller of luxury soaps in Europe and South America, as well as continuing its strong record of growth in the United States.  Despite its rapid ascent, Country Fresh prides itself on maintaining its homey atmosphere, as symbolized by its company headquarters with a farmhouse in front of a factory in a rural region of Maine, in the U.S.  The company is notably ""employee friendly,"" allowing, for instance, employees to use their personal computers for conducting business and encouraging people to work at home to spend more time with their families. As the incoming Director of Privacy, you are the company's first dedicated privacy professional.  During the interview process, you found that while the people you talked to, including Shelly Holmes, CEO, daughter of the founder, and Jim Greene, Vice President for Operations, meant well, they did not possess a sophisticated knowledge of privacy practices and regulations, and were unsure of exactly where the company stood in relation to compliance and security.  Jim candidly admitted, ""We know there's a lot we need to be thinking about and doing regarding privacy, but none of us know much about it.   We've put some safeguards in place, but we're not even sure they are effective.  We need someone to build a privacy program from the ground up."" The final interview ended after the close of business.  The cleaning crew had started its nightly work. As you walked through the office, you noticed that computers had been left on at employee work stations and the only shredder you saw was marked with a sign that said ""Out of Order. Do Not Use."" You have accepted the job offer and are about to report to work on Monday.  You are now on a plane headed toward your new office, considering your course of action in this position and jotting down some notes.  What should you do to identify the current condition of Country Fresh's privacy practices and policies? ",Cash Study 1,,"The correct answer is A: [Forming a baseline.]
Establishing the current baseline is the process of collecting “as-is” data privacy requirements in order to document the current environment.

The steps identified to create the privacy policy framework are not necessarily conducted in a rigid order, and not every organization will perform every phase. For example, for very large organizations, every phase should be completed to ensure the highest accuracy in the selection and definition of privacy definitions and drivers. The execution of these events may not need to be as formal or as time-consuming, based on organizational needs.

644,Case Study 2,"This section introduces Case Study 1, about which all questions will be asked.",,"17)  SCENARIO IIPlease use the following to answer questions 17-22:A high-end United States retail firm that specializes in custom made jewelry creates an opt-in program to provide personalized attention to its customers. On their first visit, customers are invited to log into a kiosk in the retail store to enter their various shopping preferences, as well as personal information such as credit card numbers, banking information, birthdays, anniversary dates, etc. In an effort to make the customer experience even richer, the program also collects facial recognition data, so that when a customer enters the store, an alert staff member can call the customer by name and speak knowledgeably about his or her preferences, perhaps even directing the customer to a particular item. All the customer preference data, including facial recognition data, is encrypted and stored on a computer system within the store. This computer system is also secured physically in a locked room. Because the intent of this effort was benign, i.e., to enhance the overall customer experience, theowners of the retail store don't recognize that this collection of data has the potential to become a dataprivacy issue. No policies or procedures have been developed to address how this data is used or whether it can be resold. The owners simply assume that if a customer does not want to participate, he or she won't enter data into the kiosk. An employee at the jewelry store, Matilda Jones, has full access to the data because she is themost computer-knowledgeable employee. Matilda has a friend who works for a wealth management firm in another U.S. state. Wishing to do her friend a business favor, she copies an unencrypted set of the customer names, preferences, and the facial recognition data onto a hard drive and sends it to her friend for him to use in marketing his wealth management services to preselected suitable customers. He intends to use the customer data in a way similar to the jewelers, to provide highly personalized service. Since she's not selling the data to him, Matilda doesn't think there's anything wrong with what she's done.The owners of the wealth management company buy another list of customers and information legitimately from an outside vendor. This data included financial information, as well as names, addresses, and number and brand of automobiles owned. The wealth management company collates the list with the list from the retailer, though the owners of the wealth management company are unaware the retailer's list was given informally, and now the wealth management firm has a very valuable list that contains a deep level of personal information about potential customers and their buying preferences.The man who works at the wealth management firm puts the combined list up on an unencrypted public website so that Matilda can copy it back and enhance the jewelry store's original data set. While it is exposed, the wealth management company becomes the victim of an online attack and the combined collection of customer data is stolen. The owners of the wealth management company only find this out when several of their customers report that their vehicles have been stolen. Further investigation of the crimes by the police links the data breach to home invasion burglaries. The criminals were using the stolen facial recognition data to identify potential victims, then using address data to find their primary residences. The owners of the retail jeweler have no knowledge any of this has happened until several months later, when the employee who traded their data to the wealthmanagement firm quits and informs them of the data breach.Whose responsibility was it to notify the jewelry store's customers that their data had been stolen? ",Case Study 2,," The correct answer is A: [The jewelry store’s owners.]
In the private sector, liability clauses in contracts with data processors are paramount. In the EU, the default is well established that the data controller retains legal liability for any harm associated with the collected data.

In the U.S. and some other jurisdictions, it is perfectly possible to make the processor liable for remediation costs of events caused by their negligence if it is clearly stated in contract.

Every organization is held accountable for what it says it will do and will not do with personal information. As such, it is the jewelry store’s responsibility—not wealth management’s—to provide notice as to how the jewelry store’s customer data will be used.A privacy policy is generally an internal document that is addressed to employees and clearly states how personal information is going to be handled. These documents serve as a vehicle for training staff, providing assurance that all employees understand their responsibility for personal information protection. There may be a variety of policies that detail how the organization will handle certain kinds of personal information, depending upon the purpose for which the information was collected. These policies must be clearly communicated to employees, so that information is not inadvertently used for unauthorized purposes. A notice is generally an external communication of the privacy policies to the customers about how their personal data is being handled. Notices are particularly important, because this is one means used by your organization to ingrain organizational accountability externally. Typically, notices are posted on the organization website.Technical controls, such as implementing systems that support role-based access also supports the larger purposes of the privacy program by specifically identifying and limiting who can access the personal information in a particular database.

It’s important to remember that not all breaches require notification. There are various types of notification requirements to regulators and affected individuals.
